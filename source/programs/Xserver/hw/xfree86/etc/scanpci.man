.TH SCANPCI 1 __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
scanpci - scan/probe PCI buses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scanpci
.RB [ \-v12OfV ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Scanpci
is a utility that can be used to scan PCI buses and report information
about the configuration space settings for each PCI device.
On most platforms,
.I scanpci
can only be run by the root user.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-v
Print the configuration space information for each device in a verbose
format.  Without this option, only a brief description is printed for
each device.
.TP 8
.B \-x
Show hexadecimal dump of the first 64 bytes of each PCI device's
configuration space.  For CardBus bridges, the first 128 bytes are
dumped instead.  This option can be repeated to dump all 256 or 4096 bytes,
but doing so might cause
.B scanpci
(or the system) to crash because some devices cannot tolerate reads of
undefined portions of their configuration space.
.TP 8
.B \-1
Use PCI config type 1.
.TP 8
.B \-2
Use PCI config type 2.
.TP 8
.B \-f
Used in conjunction with the above two options, this forces the specified
configuration type to be used for config space access.
.TP 8
.B \-O
Use the OS's PCI config space access mechanism to access the PCI config
space (when available).
.TP 8
.BI "\-V " n
Set the verbosity level to
.I n
for the internal PCI scanner.  This is primarily for debugging use.
