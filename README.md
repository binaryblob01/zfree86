ZFree86 - Fork of the last version of XFree86 (4.8.0)

!! This is obsolete software. DO NOT use this on a production system. !!

ZFree86 is a fork of XFree86. There was a fork due to (largely perceived) incompatible licensing changes, which created X.Org.

Our intention is to eventually re-work the source into a properly fixed graphics system, addressing all the shortfalls of the X11R6 specification. While it should largely be compatible with X11 applications, there will be some components of the API that will no longer be available. The new specification will be referred to as the Z-Windows system.

While there are newer alternatives to X-Windows, such as Wayland, they do no necessarily provide the robust and time-proven reliability of the X-Windows system.
