  <H2><A NAME="1"></A>1. Requirements</H2>

<p>Before you can either compile or execute a binary distribution of
XFree86, the following conditions must be met:
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you are running Release 5.0.4 or later. This is required
because OSS646 is only supported on those platforms. There are no plans
to support XFree86 on earlier releases of OpenServer.
    </li>
<li>Ensure that OSS646, the ``Execution Environment Update'' package is
installed, if appropriate.  Check the release notes for that update
to see whether or not your current operating system requires this
update.  At least version OSS646B is required.  If you are running
SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.7, you must have Maintenance Pack 1 installed.
    </li>
<li>Ensure that the "Graphics, Web and X11 Libraries" package is
installed.  At least version 1.3.2Ag is required.  You should always
install the latest possible version of this supplement that is valid
for your operating system release.  From time to time this release is
bundled with Maintenance Packs, so if you are running 5.0.7 or later,
the latest version may be in the latest Maintenance Pack.  Always check
the release notes for GWXLIBS to see if your platform requires the
update.  The latest version can always be found at the
<A href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5/opensrc">SCO FTP site</A>.
    </li>
<li>To compile XFree86, you must use the SCO-supported version of
the GNU C Compiler.  It is possible that the Skunkware versions of the
compiler will work too, but this has not been tested.  The ``GNU
Development System'' is available for all releases from (and including)
SCO OpenServer Release 5.0.5.  It is provided with the operating system
in all versions from Release 5.0.7, although you need to run ``custom''
to install it from the media.  You can always download the latest
latest version of the GNU Development System from the
<A href="ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/openserver5/opensrc">SCO FTP site</A>.
    </li>
<li>If you are not using OSR 5.0.7 or later, you need to get an updated
console driver.  See <A href="http://www.sco.com">http://www.sco.com</A> for details on
OpenServer supplements.  If you can't or don't want to upgrade your
console driver, XFree86 will still compile, but you may run into
problems with some cards such as the Riva TNT and ATI Rage cards.
The problem with the console driver in 5.0.6A and earlier is that
when the X server sets graphics mode, the driver does not set a
status bit, so any text that is sent directly to <code>/dev/console</code>,
such as kernel warning or notice messages when you access tape drives
or NFS notices, will be sent to the console video memory.  This just
happens to be slap bang in the middle of palette data for the Riva
TNT, so you get color map corruption.  The updated console driver
also has an improved mechanism for allocating video memory that
XFree86 detects at compile time, and it will use it if it exists.
It is STRONGLY recommended that you get the console driver update.
</li>
</ul>
