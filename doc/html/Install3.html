<HR NOSHADE>
  <H2><A NAME="3"></A>3. Installing XFree86 4.8.0 using the <code>Xinstall.sh</code> script </H2>
<p>We strongly recommend that our XFree86 4.8.0 binaries be installed
using the <code>Xinstall.sh</code> script we provide.
There are a lot of
steps in the manual installation process, and those steps can vary
according to the platform and hardware setup.  There is a description of
the manual installation process for the most common cases 
<A HREF="Install4.html#manual-install">below</A>.</p>
<p>You must login as the super user (root) to run the installer script and 
place all of the downloaded files into a single directory. 
Use the cd command to change to the chosen directory and 
run the installer script as follows:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
sh Xinstall.sh
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>Answer the prompts as they come up.  If you are missing something that
is required, the installer may tell you to install it before trying
again.  If the problem is that you did not download all of mandatory
files aforementioned, then the installer will tell you which ones are
missing and ask you to download them before proceeding.</p>

<H3><A NAME="4"></A>3.1. Questions the installer may ask </H3>
<p>The installer asks some questions that may not have obvious answers.  The
information here should help you answer them.  In most cases, apart from
the first question, the default answers should be OK.</p>
<p>If you run the installer from within an X session (the installer checks
if <code>$DISPLAY</code> is set), you will be warned that doing so is not
a good idea.  Unless you have a good reason for knowing that this will not 
be a problem, you should exit your X session, including stopping xdm or
equivalent if it is running, before continuing.  If you ignore this
warning and run into problems, well, you were warned!</p>
<p>If you have an existing X installation, you
will be warned that proceeding
with this installation will overwrite it.  Only those things that are
part of our standard distribution will be overwritten.  Other X
applications that you may have installed will not be removed.  Some
configuration files may be overwritten though, but the installer should
prompt you before doing so and will attempt to backup the existing files
first.  As the opening greeting says, it is <b>strongly</b> recommended
that you backup any existing installation before proceeding.  If you
want your old applications to still be there after you've installed, do
not do the "backup" by simply renaming your old <code>/usr/X11R6</code>
directory.  It is better to make a copy of it, and then install over the
top of the original one.  If you run into problems and want to revert
to the old installation, you can then delete the overwritten one and
copy the saved version back.</p>
<p>During the first part of the installation over an existing version, the
script may remove some old files or directories that would get in the
way of the new installation.  It will list which files/directories have
been removed.  If none are listed, then none were removed.</p>
<p>The next step when installing over an existing version is to check for
existing configuration files.  On most platforms, the run-time
configuration files are installed by default under <code>/etc/X11</code>
instead of under <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</code>.  The installer will give
you the option of moving any that are in the old location, creating the
necessary symbolic links.  If you do not want to have them moved, then
you should answer "no" when asked about it.  If you have no exiting
run-time configuration files in the <code>/etc/X11</code>, then the
new configuration files will be installed in <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</code>
instead.</p>
<p>Note: for the rare systems that do not have symbolic links, this question
will not be asked.  The default answer is "yes" because that is best for
most situations.  It makes it easier to share the <code>/usr/X11R6</code>
directory between multiple hosts, and allows it to be mounted read-only.
If you do not need these features, then you can safely answer "no" if
you do not want them moved.</p>
<p>When installing over an existing version, you will be prompted before
each set of configuration files is installed.  If you haven't made any
Customisations to your existing configuration files, then you can safely
answer "yes" for each of these.  If you have made customisations, you
can try answering "no".  If you run into problems later, you may need
to manually merge your customisations into the the new version of the
configuration files.  If your platform uses customised xinit or xdm
configuration files, overwriting them may prevent your usual desktop
from coming up after installing XFree86.  For this reason you may wish
to answer "no" when prompted for those files.  An important set of files
to answer "yes" to is the xkb files.  If they are not up to date you may
run into problems running the latest XFree86 server.</p>
<p>The installer will attempt to make a backup of your original files before
copying in the new ones.  This may not be foolproof and it is recommended
that you still make your own backup of everything first.  If you wish
to install the configuration manually, they can be found in the
<code>Xetc.tgz</code> and <code>Xrc.tgz</code> tarballs.  See the 
<A HREF="Install4.html#manual-install">section below</A> about manual installation for
information about extracting them separately.</p>
<p>After the configuration files have been dealt with, the other mandatory
components of the binary distribution will be installed.  This should
proceed without any user intervention.</p>
<p>If you downloaded any of the optional components, the installer will
ask you about each one before it is installed.  The default answer is
"yes".  If there are any that you've since decided that you do not want
to install, answer "no" when prompted.</p>
<p>After that is done, the main part of the installation is complete.  The
next steps are to tidy up some aspects of the installation.  The first
of these is to run "<code>ldconfig</code>" on systems that require it, so
that the newly installed shared libraries are accessible.  Then
the <code>fonts.dir</code> files in some directories are updated so that
the fonts can be accessed correctly.  Next, the installer checks to
see if your system has a termcap file or terminfo files.  If it finds
the former, it tells you how you may update the entries in that file.
If it finds the latter, it asks you if you want it to update them
for you.</p>
<p>You may be asked if you want to create links for the GL libraries and
header files.  The OpenGL standard on some platforms (Linux in particular)
says that these should be installed in the standard system locations
(<code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/include</code>), so the installer offers
to create the appropriate links.  If you're running Linux, you should
probably answer yes.  For other platforms it is your choice.  If you
already have another version of libGL in /usr/lib, answering "yes" will
remove it and replace it with a link to the version we supply.  The
installer will show you a listing of any existing versions before asking
if they should be replaced.</p>
<p>Finally, the installer asks you if you want a link created for the
<code>rstart</code> utility.  On most modern systems the link isn't essential,
so the default answer is "no".  Answer "yes" if you know that you need
it.  If you find later that you need it, you can create it easily by
running:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
rm -f /usr/bin/rstartd
ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/rstartd /usr/bin/rstartd
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>


<H3><A NAME="5"></A>3.2. After the installation is complete </H3>
<p>The next step is to get the XFree86 server running.  The recommended
way to do this is to run:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
XFree86 -autoconfig
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>This will work well in many cases, and if it suits your needs you can
make it the default by simply moving/renaming any existing
<code>XF86Config</code> file so that the XFree86 server does not find it.
If it doesn't, or if you want to make changes to the auto-detected
configuration, try the <code>xf86cfg</code> or <code>xf86config</code> utilities
or try running:</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
XFree86 -configure
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>Note that if you are running Darwin/Mac OS X, there is no step 3 :-).
You should skip this step, as configuration is not required or possible.
The X server configuration file is not used on Darwin/Mac OS X.</p>
<p>After the X server configuration is done, it may be advisable to reboot,
especially if you run xdm (or equivalent) or the font server (xfs).</p>
