<HR NOSHADE>
  <H2><A NAME="2"></A>2. Downloading the XFree86 4.8.0 binaries </H2>


<p>We provide XFree86 4.8.0 binaries for a range
of operating systems at our
<A href="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.8.0/binaries/">ftp site</A>
and our
<A href="http://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.8.0/binaries/">web site</A>.
Often during releases our site is heavily loaded.  Instead of downloading
directly from us we recommend that instead you use one of our mirror
sites.</p>

<p>Our binaries are organized by sub-directories which correspond to each
of the OS/platforms for which we provide binaries.  First go to the
sub-directory  that represents your OS platform. In some cases (e.g.,
Linux) there may be a number of choices depending on the architecture
or libc version your platform uses.  In all case we recommend that you
first download the <code>Xinstall.sh</code> script, and run it as in the
following example to find out which binary distribution you should
download.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
sh Xinstall.sh -check
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>The output of this utility tells you which is the correct set of binaries
for you to download.  If you are careful with this step you will save
yourself a lot time and trouble from NOT downloading an incompatible
distribution.</p>
<p><b>NOTES</b>:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The Xinstall.sh script must be downloaded in binary mode,
otherwise it will not  run correctly.  If you get lots of "command
not found" messages when you try to run it, then it is most
likely because the script was not  downloaded in binary mode.
Some web browsers will not  do this for files of that name, so we
also have a copy of it called "<code>Xinstall.bin</code>", and most
browsers should download that correctly.  When downloading it
under this name, select "save as" on your browser, and save the
file under the name "<code>Xinstall.sh</code>".
</li>
<li>The Xinstall.sh script requires some system commands and
utilities to function correctly.  While most systems will have
these, some Linux installations may not.  If the
script fails because of some missing system command, you
need to install it before you can continue. 
</li>
<li>Always use the version of the Xinstall.sh script that is provided
with the release.   Older versions of the script may not install
newer releases correctly.
</li>
<li>If the binary distribution reported by the Xinstall.sh script
is not present on the XFree86 site, then there are two
possibilities: The first is that it has not uploaded yet.  This
is likeliest possibility if you are looking shortly after the
release date.  The second possibility is that your target will
not be be available for this release.  This is likeliest
possibility if you are looking more than about two weeks after
the release date.  Check <A href="http://www.xfree86.org/4.8.0/UPDATES.html">here</A> for
information about updates to our binary distributions, and <A href="http://www.xfree86.org/4.8.0/ERRATA.html">here</A>
for errata related to this release.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Assuming that you have run the <code>Xinstall.sh</code> script and found the binary
distribution suitable for your system,
download the necessary files.  The thirteen (13) mandatory files for all installations are listed
below.  The installer script will complain if you do not have all of the
required files in the same directory.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
1.   Xinstall.sh    The installer script
2.   extract        The utility for extracting tarballs
3.   Xbin.tgz       X clients/utilities and run-time libraries
4.   Xlib.tgz       Some data files required at run-time
5.   Xman.tgz       Manual pages
6.   Xdoc.tgz       XFree86 documentation
7.   Xfnts.tgz      Base set of fonts
8.   Xfenc.tgz      Base set of font encoding data
9.   Xetc.tgz       Run-time configuration files, part 1
10.  Xrc.tgz        Run-time configuration files, part 2
11.  Xvar.tgz       Run-time data
12.  Xxserv.tgz     XFree86 X server
13.  Xmod.tgz       XFree86 X server modules
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>NOTES:
<ul>
<li>Some web browsers have a problem downloading the <code>extract</code>
utility correctly.  If you encounter this problem, download the
version called <code>extract.exe</code>.  (NOTE: This is not a
MS-DOS/Windows       executable.)
</li>
<li>Some distributions do not require the <code>Xvar.tgz</code>
tarball.  If it is present in the <code>binaries</code> sub-directory
for your platform, then it is required.
</li>
<li>The Darwin/Mac OS X distribution do not have or require the
<code>Xmod.tgz</code> tarball.
</li>
<li>Some distributions may have additional mandatory tarballs.
While rare, the installer script will tell you if any are missing.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The following thirteen (13) tarballs are optional.  You should download
the ones you want to install.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
1.   Xdrm.tgz       Source for DRM kernel modules
2.   Xfsrv.tgz      Font server
3.   Xnest.tgz      Nested X server
4.   Xprog.tgz      X header files, config files and compile-time libs
5.   Xprt.tgz       X Print server
6.   Xvfb.tgz       Virtual framebuffer X server
7.   Xtinyx.tgz     TinyX servers
8.   Xf100.tgz      100dpi fonts
9.   Xfcyr.tgz      Cyrillic fonts
10.  Xfscl.tgz      Scalable fonts (Speedo, Type1 and TrueType)
11.  Xhtml.tgz      HTML version of the documentation
12.  Xps.tgz        PostScript version of the documentation
13.  Xpdf.tgz       PDF version of the documentation
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>NOTES:
<ul>
<li>Not all distributions will have all of the above optional tarballs.
</li>
<li>Some distributions may have some additional optional tarballs.
</li>
</ul>
