  <H2><A NAME="29"></A>4. Conclusion and Recommendations </H2>
<p>We recommend a three phase implementation strategy, based on
how an application could be written to take advantage of
scaling:
<ol>
<li><p>The XCopyAreaScaled extension should be implemented, since
this is the ideal solution for applications like VNC, and
since making use of this extension will require minimal
changes to applications that already use XPutImage or
XCopyArea.</p>
<p>The initial implementation work would include the design
of the X protocol extension, writing this up in the
usual format for extension documentation, implementation
of the protocol transport pieces in XFree86,
implementation of a software fall-back in XFree86 and
DMX, one example hardware implementation for XFree86,
and implementation of support for this extension in DMX.</p>
<p>We suggest implementing the extension first on the ATI
Radeon cards.  However, since these cards do not provide
a 2D scaled blit primitive, the implementation would
have to make use of the 3D texture engine to emulate a
scaled blit.  This is recommended, since other modern
graphics cards also do not provide a simple 2D scaled
blit operation and an example of the more difficult
implementation pathway would be helpful to others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Until XCopyAreaScaled is widely supported, applications
that require scaling will have to fall back to another
scaling method.  We suggest OpenGL as the first fall-back
method because it is widely available and supported by
DMX.</p>
<p>A project centered around OpenGL-based scaling would
implement this scaling in VNC as an example.  This work
would include re-writing the <code>vncviewer</code>
rendering engine to cache a master copy of the desktop
image for all operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since OpenGL is not implemented everywhere, and may not
provide hardware-assisted performance in every
implementation, an application that requires scaling
should also fall back to using the X Video Extension.</p>
<p>This project would add support for the X Video Extension
to DMX and would add support to VNC to take advantage of
this extension without introducing artifacts.  This
would require modifying the <code>vncviewer</code> rendering
engine to cache a master copy of the desktop image for
all operations.  This project should also add support
for the RGB format to at least one XFree86 driver (e.g.,
ATI Radeon).</p>
<p>The X Video Extension is one of the few popular
extensions that DMX does not support.  We recommend
implementing the X Video Extension even if scaling is
the specific goal of that work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>We do <b>not</b> recommend implementation of the
XCreateScaledWindow extension because of the complexity
involved.  We do <b>not</b> recommend implementation of the
XPutImageScaled extension because it requires the same amount
of work as the XCopyAreaScaled extension, but provides less
functionality.  Further, server-side scaling with a large
frame buffer is <b>not</b> recommended because of the
performance implications.</p>
<p>The back-end scaling, especially with disconnect/reconnect
support should be explored in the future after
disconnect/reconnect is implemented, but not at the present
time.</p>
