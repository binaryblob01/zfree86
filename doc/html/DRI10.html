  <H2><A NAME="23"></A>10. Hardware-Specific Information and Troubleshooting </H2>
<p>This section presents hardware-specific information for normal
use and troubleshooting.</p>

<H3><A NAME="24"></A>10.1. 3dfx Banshee, Voodoo3, Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 Series </H3>

<H4><A NAME="25"></A>10.1.1. Requirements </H4>
<p>The 3dfx DRI driver requires special versions of the 3dfx Glide
library.
Different versions of Glide are needed for Banshee/Voodoo3 than
for Voodoo4/5.
The Glide libraries can be downloaded from the DRI website.</p>

<H4><A NAME="26"></A>10.1.2. Configuration </H4>
<p>Your XF86Config file's device section must specify the
<code>tdfx</code> device.  For example:
<pre>
        Section "Device"
            Identifier  "Voodoo3"
            VendorName  "3dfx"
            Driver      "tdfx"
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>
<pre>
        Section "Device"
            Identifier  "Voodoo5"
            VendorName  "3dfx"
            Driver      "tdfx"
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>
<p>The Screen section should then reference the Voodoo device:
<pre>
	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier  "Screen 1"
	    Device      "Voodoo3"
	    Monitor     "High Res Monitor"
	    DefaultDepth 16
	    Subsection "Display"
		Depth       16
		Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
		ViewPort    0 0
	    EndSubsection
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>
<p>Or,</p>

<p>
<pre>
	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier  "Screen 1"
	    Device      "Voodoo5"
	    Monitor     "High Res Monitor"
	    DefaultDepth 24
	    Subsection "Display"
		Depth       16
		Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
		ViewPort    0 0
	    EndSubsection
	    Subsection "Display"
		Depth       24
		Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
		ViewPort    0 0
	    EndSubsection
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>

<p>The kernel module for 3dfx hardware is named <code>tdfx.o</code> and
should be installed in /lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/char/drm/.
It will be automatically loaded by the Xserver if needed.</p>
<p>The DRI 3D driver for 3dfx hardware should be in
<code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/tdfx_dri.so</code>.
This will be automatically loaded by libGL.so.</p>
<p>The Voodoo5 supports 3D rendering in 16 and 32 bpp modes.
When running in 32bpp mode an 8-bit stencil buffer and 24-bit
Z (depth) buffer are offered.
When running in 16bpp mode only a 16-bit Z (depth) buffer is
offered and stencil is implemented in software.</p>
<p>A software-based accumulation buffer is available in both
16 and 32bpp modes.</p>

<H4><A NAME="27"></A>10.1.3. Troubleshooting </H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you try to run an OpenGL application and see an error message
similar to
<pre>
      gd error (glide): gd error (glide): grSstSelect:  non-existent SSTgd error (glide): grSstSelect:  non-existent SSTS
              
</pre>

it means that you have the wrong version of the Glide library
for your hardware.</li>
<li>3D acceleration for Banshee and Voodoo3 is only supported in
the 16 bit/pixel screen mode.
Use <code>xdpyinfo</code> to verify that all your visuals are depth 16.
Edit your XF86Config file if needed.</li>
<li>The <code>/dev/3dfx</code> device is not used for DRI; it's only for
Glide on older 3dfx hardware.</li>
<li>Different versions of Glide are needed for Voodoo3 and Voodoo5.
See the DRI website's resources page to download the right
version of Glide.</li>
<li>Voodoo4/5 may be run at 24bpp (instead of 32bpp, the default)
but 3D acceleration is not supported in that mode.
32bpp mode is fully 3D accelerated.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="28"></A>10.1.4. Performance and Features </H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, buffer swapping in double-buffered applications is
synchronized to your monitor's refresh rate.
This may be overridden by setting the <code>FX_GLIDE_SWAPINTERVAL</code>
environment variable.
The value of this variable indicates the maximum number of
swap buffer commands can be buffered.
Zero allows maximum frame rate.</li>
<li>On Voodoo4/5, rendering with 16-bits/texel textures is faster
than using 32-bit per texel textures.
The <code>internalFormat</code> parameter to <code>glTexImage2D</code> can be
used to control texel size.
Quake3 and other games let you control this as well.</li>
<li>The <code>glTexEnv</code> mode <code>GL_BLEND</code> is not directly supported
by the Voodoo3 hardware.
It can be accomplished with a multi-pass algorithm but it's not
implemented at this time.
Applications which use that mode, such as the Performer Town
demo, may become sluggish when falling back to software
rendering to render in that mode.</li>
<li>The Voodoo3/Banshee driver reverts to software rendering under
the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Setting <code>GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL</code> to
<code>GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR</code>.</li>
<li>Enabling line stippling or polygon stippling.</li>
<li>Enabling point smoothing or polygon smoothing.</li>
<li>Enabling line smoothing when line width is not 1.0.
That is, antialiased lines are done in hardware only when
the line width is 1.0.</li>
<li>Using 1-D or 3-D texture maps.</li>
<li>Using the GL_BLEND texture environment.</li>
<li>Using stencil operations.</li>
<li>Using the accumulation buffer.</li>
<li>Using <code>glBlendEquation(GL_LOGIC_OP)</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK)</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>glPolygonMode(face, GL_POINT)</code> or
<code>glPolygonMode(face, GL_LINE)</code>.</li>
<li>Using point size attenuation
(i.e. <code>GL_DISTANCE_ATTENUATION_EXT</code>).</li>
<li>Using <code>glColorMask(r, g, b, a)</code> when r!=g or g!=b.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Voodoo5 driver reverts to software rendering under the
same conditions Voodoo3 with three exceptions.
First, stencil operations are implemented in hardware when the
screen is configured for 32 bits/pixel.
Second, the <code>GL_BLEND</code> texture env mode is fully supported in
hardware.
Third, <code>glColorMask</code> is fully supported in hardware when
the screen is configured for 32 bits/pixel.</li>
<li>As of January, 2001 the second VSA-100 chip on the Voodoo5 is
not yet operational.
Therefore, the board isn't being used to its full capacity.
The second VSA-100 chip will allow Scan-Line Interleave (SLI)
mode for full-screen applications and games, potentially doubling
the system's fill rate.
When the second VSA-100 chip is activated
glGetString(GL_RENDERER) will report Voodoo5 instead of Voodoo4.</li>
<li>The lowest mipmap level is sometimes miscolored in trilinear-
sampled polygons.</li>
<li>The GL_EXT_texture_env_combine extension is supported on the
Voodoo4 and Voodoo5.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="29"></A>10.1.5. Known Problems </H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The lowest mipmap level is sometimes miscolored in trilinear-
sampled polygons (Voodoo3/Banshee).</li>
<li>Fog doesn't work with orthographic projections.</li>
<li>The accuracy of blending operations on Voodoo4/5 isn't always
very good.
If you run Glean, you'll find some test failures.</li>
<li>The Glide library cannot be used directly; it's only meant to
be used via the tdfx DRI driver.</li>
<li>SSystem has problems because of poorly set near and far
clipping planes.
The office.unc Performer model also suffers from this problem.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<H3><A NAME="30"></A>10.2. Intel i810 </H3>

<H4><A NAME="31"></A>10.2.1. Requirements </H4>
<p>A kernel with AGP GART support (such as Linux 2.4.x) is needed.</p>


<H4><A NAME="32"></A>10.2.2. Configuration </H4>
<p>Your XF86Config file's device section must specify the
<code>i810</code> device, and specify a usable amount of video
ram to reserve.
<pre>
        Section "Device"
            Identifier  "i810"
            VendorName  "Intel"
            Driver      "i810"
	    Option	"AGPMode" "1"
	    VideoRam    10000
        EndSection
            
</pre>

The Screen section should then reference the i810 device:
<pre>
	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier  "Screen 1"
	    Device      "i810"
	    Monitor     "High Res Monitor"
	    DefaultDepth 16
	    Subsection "Display"
		Depth       16
		Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
		ViewPort    0 0
	    EndSubsection
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>
<p>The kernel module for the i810 is named <code>i810.o</code> and
should be installed in /lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/char/drm/.
It will be automatically loaded by the Xserver if needed.</p>
<p>The DRI 3D driver for the i810 should be in
<code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/i810_dri.so</code>.
This will be automatically loaded by libGL.so.</p>

<H4><A NAME="33"></A>10.2.3. Troubleshooting </H4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>3D acceleration for the i810 is only available in the 16
bit/pixel screen mode at this time.  32bpp acceleration is
not supported by this hardware.
Use <code>xdpyinfo</code> to verify that all your visuals are depth 16.
Edit your XF86Config file if needed.</li>
<li>The i810 uses system ram for video and 3d graphics.  The X
server will ordinarily reserve 4mb of ram for graphics,
which is too little for an effective 3d setup.  To tell
the driver to use a larger amount, specify a VideoRam
option in the Device section of your XF86Config file.  A
number between 10000 and 16384 seems adequate for most
requirements.  If too little memory is available for DMA
buffers, back and depth buffers and textures, direct
rendering will be disabled.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="34"></A>10.2.4. Performance and Features </H4>
<p>Basically all of the i810 features which can be exposed through
OpenGL 1.2 are implemented.
However, the following OpenGL features are implemented in software
and will be slow:
<ul>
<li>Stencil buffer and accumulation buffer operations</li>
<li>Blend subtract, min/max and logic op blend modes</li>
<li>glColorMask when any mask is set to false</li>
<li>GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR lighting mode</li>
<li>glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK)</li>
<li>Using 1D or 3D textures</li>
<li>Using texture borders</li>
</ul>
</p>


<H3><A NAME="35"></A>10.3. Matrox G200 and G400 </H3>

<H4><A NAME="36"></A>10.3.1. Requirements </H4>
<p>A kernel with AGP GART support (such as Linux 2.4.x) is needed.</p>

<H4><A NAME="37"></A>10.3.2. Configuration </H4>
<p>Your XF86Config file's device section must specify the
<code>mga</code> device:  
<pre>
        Section "Device"
            Identifier  "MGA"
            VendorName  "Matrox"
            Driver      "mga"
	    Option	"AGPMode" "1"
	    VideoRam    32768
        EndSection
            
</pre>

The Screen section should then reference the MGA device:
<pre>
	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier  "Screen 1"
	    Device      "MGA"
	    Monitor     "High Res Monitor"
	    DefaultDepth 16
	    Subsection "Display"
		Depth       16
		Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
		ViewPort    0 0
	    EndSubsection
        EndSection
            
</pre>

To use a 32bpp screen mode, use this <code>Screen</code> section
instead:
<pre>
	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier  "Screen 1"
	    Device      "MGA"
	    Monitor     "High Res Monitor"
	    DefaultDepth 24
            DefaultFbBpp 32
	    Subsection "Display"
		Depth       24
		Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
		ViewPort    0 0
	    EndSubsection
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>

<p>The kernel module for the G200/G400 is named <code>mga.o</code> and
should be installed in /lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/char/drm/.
It will be automatically loaded by the Xserver if needed.</p>
<p>The DRI 3D driver for the G200/G400 should be in
<code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/mga_dri.so</code>.
This will be automatically loaded by libGL.so.</p>

<H4><A NAME="38"></A>10.3.3. Performance and Features </H4>
<p>Software rendering will be used under any of the
following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Using glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK).</li>
<li>Using point, line, or triangle smoothing.</li>
<li>Using glLogicOp.</li>
<li>Using glPolygonStipple or glLineStipple.</li>
<li>Using 1D or 3D textures.</li>
<li>Using texture borders.</li>
<li>Using glDepthFunc(GL_NEVER).</li>
<li>Using the accumulation buffer.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The AGP mode may be set to 1, 2, or 4.  One is used by default.
Higher AGP speeds may result in unreliable performance depending
on your motherboard.</p>

<p>Compaq has funded the implementation of AGP accelerated
ReadPixels and DrawPixels in this driver.  With this
implementation, on a G400 drawing directly from AGP memory
(exported to the client), throughput of up to 1 GB/sec has
been measured.</p>

<p>Additionally Compaq's funding has produced several new
extensions in Mesa, including one (packed_depth_stencil_MESA)
which enables Read/DrawPixels functionality to operate
directly on the packed 24/8 depth/stencil buffers of this
hardware.</p>

<p>In order to access this functionality, the application must
ensure that all pixel processing operations are disabled.
There are in addition a fairly complex set of rules regarding
which packing/unpacking modes must be used, and which data
formats are supported, and alignment constraints.  See the
files in lib/GL/mesa/src/drv/mga/DOCS for a summary of these.
The extension definitions are included in the Mesa 3.4 source
distribution.</p>


<H4><A NAME="39"></A>10.3.4. IRQ Assignment </H4>
<p>There have been problems in the past with the MGA driver being very
sluggish when the DRI is enabled (to the point of being unusable.)
This is caused by the graphics card not having an interrupt assigned
to it. 
The current DRI trunk will attempt to detect this condition and
bail out gracefully.</p>
<p>The solution to the above problem is to assign an interrupt to your
graphics card.
This is something you must turn on in your system BIOS configuration.
Please consult your system BIOS manual for instructions
on how to enable an interrupt for your graphics card.</p>


<H4><A NAME="40"></A>10.3.5. MGA HAL lib </H4>
<p>MGAHALlib.a is a binary library Matrox has provided for use under
Linux to expose functionality for which they can not provide
documentation. 
(For example TV-Out requires MacroVision be enabled on the output.) 
This binary library also sets the pixel/memory clocks to the optimal
settings for your Matrox card.</p>
<p>Currently the MGAHAL library is required for the G450 to work.
You can download this from the driver section on Matrox's website: 
<A href="http://www.matrox.com/mga/">www.matrox.com/mga</A></p>
<p>Here modifications to the DRI build instructions which make the
mga ddx driver use the MGAHAL library:
<pre>
	  1.Put the following define in your host.def file
		  #define UseMatroxHal YES
	  2. Place mgaHALlib.a in the following directory
		  xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/mga/HALlib/
          
</pre>
</p>
<p>You can use DualHead on the G400/G450 DH cards by creating two
device sections which both point to the same BusID.
For most AGP devices the BusID will be "PCI:1:0:0".
Configure your screen section as you would normally configure
XFree86 4.x Multihead.  It should be noted that currently
the second head does not support direct rendering.</p>


<H4><A NAME="41"></A>10.3.6. Known Problems </H4>
<p>None.</p>



<H3><A NAME="42"></A>10.4. ATI Rage 128 </H3>

<H4><A NAME="43"></A>10.4.1. Requirements </H4>
<p>A kernel with AGP GART support (such as Linux 2.4.x) is needed.</p>

<H4><A NAME="44"></A>10.4.2. Configuration </H4>
<p>Your XF86Config file's device section must specify the
<code>ati</code> device:
<pre>
        Section "Device"
            Identifier  "Rage128"
            VendorName  "ATI"
            Driver      "ati"

	    Option	"UseCCEFor2D" "false"
        EndSection
            
</pre>

The Screen section should then reference the Rage 128 device:

	    EndSubsection
        EndSection
            
</pre>
</p>
<p>The kernel module for the Rage 128 is named <code>r128.o</code> and
should be installed in /lib/modules/2.4.x/kernel/drivers/char/drm/.
It will be automatically loaded by the Xserver if needed.</p>
<p>The DRI 3D driver for the Rage 128 should be in
<code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/r128_dri.so</code>.
This will be automatically loaded by libGL.so.</p>
<p>You may also set your screen depth to 32 for 32bpp mode.</p>


<H4><A NAME="45"></A>10.4.3. Performance and Features </H4>
<p>While PCI Rage 128 based cards are supported, they do not yet
support PCI GART, so they will not perform as well as their
AGP counterparts.</p>
<p>For AGP cards, the AGP mode may be set to 1, 2, or 4.  One is
used by default.
Higher AGP speeds may result in unreliable performance depending
on your motherboard.</p>
<p>Note that even at 32bpp there is no alpha channel.</p>
<p>The following OpenGL features are implemented in software and
will be slow:
<ul>
<li>accumulation buffer operations</li>
<li>stencil, when using a 16bpp screen</li>
<li>Blend subtract, min/max and logic op blend modes</li>
<li>GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR lighting mode</li>
<li>glDrawBuffer(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK)</li>
<li>Using 1D or 3D textures</li>
<li>Using texture borders</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="46"></A>10.4.4. Known Problems </H4>
<p>If you experience stability problems you may try setting the
<code>UseCCEFor2D</code> option to <code>true</code>.  This will
effectively disable 2D hardware acceleration.  Performance will
be degraded, of course.</p>

<p>The GL_EXT_texture_env_combine, GL_EXT_texture_env_add and
GL_EXT_texture_env_dot3 extensions are supported (or will be
soon supported in the new driver based on Mesa 3.5).</p>
<p>We hope to implement support for the following features in the
future:
<ul>
<li>Vertex transformation, clipping and lighting (TCL)</li>
<li>Hardware stencil buffer</li>
<li>Cube map textures</li>
<li>3D textures</li>
<li>Three texture units</li>
</ul>
</p>

<H4><A NAME="51"></A>10.5.4. Known Problems </H4>
<p>Certain (early?) revisions of the AMD Irongate chipset have
AGPGART problems which effect Radeon, and other graphics cards.
The card may work unreliably, or not work at all.  If the DRM
kernel module is not loaded, the 2D Xserver may work.  There's
hope that this can be fixed in the future.</p>


<H3><A NAME="52"></A>10.6. 3DLabs Oxygen GMX 2000 </H3>
<p>The driver for this hardware was experimental and is no longer being
developed or supported.</p>
