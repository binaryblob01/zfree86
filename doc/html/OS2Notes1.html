  <H2><A NAME="1"></A>1. Preface </H2>
<p>X11 and XFree86 were initially developed on Unix-based systems. Usually
Unix systems provide a rich number of tools and utilities to get certain
things done. Under OS/2, these tools are not installed, but ports are
available which are sometimes functionally equivalent to Unix utilities
with the same name, but also differ sometimes in a subtle way.
This guide will give you hints if you intend to rebuild the system
from scratch under OS/2.</p>
<p>Please also read <A href="OS2.html">README.OS2</A> for end-user
information, and set at least the environment variables described there.</p>
<p>At the current time, the most recent version available is XFree86-4.0.
This is a full and unrestricted version which comes with complete source 
code. 4.0 is a highly experimental release, so many features that might
have worked in earlier versions, may now no longer work, or work differently.
Be aware that for OS/2, XFree86-4.0 is considered to be alpha software.</p>
<p>If you want to join the XFree86 developer team, e.g. to add support for
certain hardware, please send a request to 
<EM><A HREF="mailto:BOD@XFree86.org">BOD@XFree86.org</A></EM>
.
Please think about such a step carefully before, though, since much work
is involved. Please use the XFree86-4.0 source code as a test example
how to compile the system. The ability to manage that is a basic
requirement for becoming a developer.</p>
