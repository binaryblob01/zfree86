  <H2><A NAME="31"></A>10. Driver versions</H2>
<p>With the introduction of loadable drivers in XFree86 4.0, it has become
necessary to track driver versions separately.
Driver releases use the following version numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Version 1 of this driver is the one I inherited from Rik Faith and is the
version found in XFree86 releases 2.0 and 2.1.</p>
<p>Version 2 is my first rewrite which ended up being a partially successful
attempt at generalising the driver for all of VGA Wonders, Mach32, and the
early Mach64 adapters.
Various releases of this version of the driver can be found in XFree86 2.1.1,
3.1, 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.</p>
<p>Version 3 represents my second rewrite, a rather lame one at that, but in
version 3, I introduced clock programming for Mach64 adapters and merged in the
old ati_test debugging tool.
This is found in XFree86 releases 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.1.</p>
<p>Version 4 is a major restructuring of the previous version which became larger
than I could comfortably handle in one source file.
This is the version found in XFree86 releases 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.3.1, 3.3.3.2, 3.3.4,
3.3.5 and 3.3.6.</p>
<p>Version 5 is an almost complete restructuring of version 4, made to fit into
the new driver API that XFree86 4.0 and later adopted.</p>
<p>Version 6 begins the process of porting the driver to non-Intel
architectures.</p>
<p>Version 7 introduces a much more ``mature'' port of this driver to all
architectures supported by the core server.</p>
