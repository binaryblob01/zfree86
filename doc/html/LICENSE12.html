<p><b>0. Definitions</b></p>
<p>Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and
Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
beta or final release.</p>
<p>`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.
This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType
engine'.</p>
<p>This license applies to all files distributed in the original
FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and
documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its
original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.
If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by
this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>
<p>The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner,
Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
specified below.</p>
<p><b>1. No Warranty</b></p>

<p><b>2. Redistribution</b></p>
<p>This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,

authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted
herein, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Redistribution of source code must retain the license file

the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
documentation.  The copyright notices of the unaltered,
original files must be preserved in all copies of source

</li>
<li>Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that
states that the software is based in part of the work of the
FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also
encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your

following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation
or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',
`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.</p>
<p>As you have not signed this license, you are not required to
