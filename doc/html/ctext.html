<a name="1. Overview"></a>
<h2>1. Overview</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Compound
Text is a format for multiple character set data, such as
multi-lingual text. The format is based on ISO standards for
encoding and combining character sets. Compound Text is
intended to be used in three main contexts: inter-client
communication using selections, as defined in the
<i>Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</i>
(ICCCM); window properties (e.g., window manager hints as
defined in the ICCCM); and resources (e.g., as defined in
Xlib and the Xt Intrinsics).</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Compound
Text is intended as an external representation, or
interchange format, not as an internal representation. It is
expected (but not required) that clients will convert
Compound Text to some internal representation for processing
and rendering, and convert from that internal representation
to Compound Text when providing textual data to another
client.</small></p>

<a name="2. Values"></a>
<h2>2. Values</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The name of
this encoding is &lsquo;&lsquo;COMPOUND_TEXT&rsquo;&rsquo;.
When text values are used in the ICCCM-compliant selection
mechanism or are stored as window properties in the server,
the type used should be the atom for
&lsquo;&lsquo;COMPOUND_TEXT&rsquo;&rsquo;.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Octet values
are represented in this document as two decimal numbers in
the form col/row. This means the value (col * 16) + row. For
example, 02/01 means the value 33.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>For our
purposes, the octet encoding space is divided into four
ranges:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext1.png" alt="Image ctext1.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>C0 and C1
are &lsquo;&lsquo;control character&rsquo;&rsquo; sets,
while GL and GR are &lsquo;&lsquo;graphic
character&rsquo;&rsquo; sets. Only a subset of C0 and C1
octets are used in the encoding, and depending on the
character set encoding defined as GL or GR, a subset of GL
and GR octets may be used; see below for details. All octets
(00/00 to 15/15) may appear inside the text of extended
segments (defined below).</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[For those
familiar with ISO 2022, we will use only an 8-bit
environment, and we will always use G0 for GL and G1 for
GR.]</small></p>

<a name="3. Control Characters"></a>
<h2>3. Control Characters</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>In C0, only
the following values will be used:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext2.png" alt="Image ctext2.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>In C1, only
the following value will be used:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext3.png" alt="Image ctext3.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[The
alternate 7-bit CSI encoding 01/11 05/11 is not used in
Compound Text.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>No control
sequences are defined in Compound Text for changing the C0
and C1 sets.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>A horizontal
tab can be represented with the octet 00/09. Specification
of tabulation width settings is not part of Compound Text
and must be obtained from context (in an unspecified
manner).</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[Inclusion
of horizontal tab is for consistency with the STRING type
currently defined in the ICCCM.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>A newline
(line separator/terminator) can be represented with the
octet 00/10.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[Note that
00/10 is normally LINEFEED, but is being interpreted as
NEWLINE. This can be thought of as using the (deprecated)
NEW LINE mode, E.1.3, in ISO 6429. Use of this value instead
of 08/05 (NEL, NEXT LINE) is for consistency with the STRING
type currently defined in the ICCCM.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The
remaining C0 and C1 values (01/11 and 09/11) are only used
in the control sequences defined below.</small></p>

<a name="4. Standard Character Set Encodings"></a>
<h2>4. Standard Character Set Encodings</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The default
GL and GR sets in Compound Text correspond to the left and
right halves of ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1). As such, any legal
instance of a STRING type (as defined in the ICCCM) is also
a legal instance of type COMPOUND_TEXT.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[The implied
initial state in ISO 2022 is defined with the sequence: <br>
01/11 02/00 04/03 GO and G1 in an 8-bit environment only.
Designation also invokes. <br>
01/11 02/00 04/07 In an 8-bit environment, C1 represented as
8-bits. <br>
01/11 02/00 04/09 Graphic character sets can be 94 or 96.
<br>
01/11 02/00 04/11 8-bit code is used. <br>
01/11 02/08 04/02 Designate ASCII into G0. <br>
01/11 02/13 04/01 Designate right-hand part of ISO Latin-1
into G1. <br>
]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>To define
one of the approved standard character set encodings to be
the GL set, one of the following control sequences is
used:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext4.png" alt="Image ctext4.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>To define
one of the approved standard character set encodings to be
the GR set, one of the following control sequences is
used:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext5.png" alt="Image ctext5.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The
&lsquo;&lsquo;F&rsquo;&rsquo;in the control sequences above
stands for &lsquo;&lsquo;Final character&rsquo;&rsquo;,
which is always in the range 04/00 to 07/14. The
&lsquo;&lsquo;{I}&rsquo;&rsquo; stands for zero or more
&lsquo;&lsquo;intermediate characters&rsquo;&rsquo;, which
are always in the range 02/00 to 02/15, with the first
intermediate character always in the range 02/01 to 02/03.
The registration authority has defined an &lsquo;&lsquo;{I}
F&rsquo;&rsquo; sequence for each registered character set
encoding.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[Final
characters for private encodings (in the range 03/00 to
03/15) are not permitted here in Compound Text.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>For GL,
octet 02/00 is always defined as SPACE, and octet 07/15
(normally DELETE) is never used. For a 94-character set
defined as GR, octets 10/00 and 15/15 are never
used.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[This is
consistent with ISO 2022.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>A 94
<small>N</small> character set uses N octets (N &gt; 1) for
each character. The value of N is derived from the column
value for F:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext6.png" alt="Image ctext6.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>In a 94
<small>N</small> encoding, the octet values 02/00 and 07/15
(in GL) and 10/00 and 15/15 (in GR) are never
used.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[The column
definitions come from ISO 2022.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Once a GL or
GR set has been defined, all further octets in that range
(except within control sequences and extended segments) are
interpreted with respect to that character set encoding,
until the GL or GR set is redefined. GL and GR sets can be
defined independently, they do not have to be defined in
pairs.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Note that
when actually using a character set encoding as the GR set,
you must force the most significant bit (08/00) of each
octet to be a one, so that it falls in the range 10/00 to
15/15.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[Control
sequences to specify character set encoding revisions (as in
section 6.3.13 of ISO 2022) are not used in Compound Text.
Revision indicators do not appear to provide useful
information in the context of Compound Text. The most recent
revision can always be assumed, since revisions are upward
compatible.]</small></p>

<a name="5. Approved Standard Encodings"></a>
<h2>5. Approved Standard Encodings</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The
following are the approved standard encodings to be used
with Compound Text. Note that none have Intermediate
characters; however, a good parser will still deal with
Intermediate characters in the event that additional
encodings are later added to this list.</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext7.png" alt="Image ctext7.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The sets
listed as &lsquo;&lsquo;Left half of ...&rsquo;&rsquo;
should always be defined as GL. The sets listed as
&lsquo;&lsquo;Right half of ...&rsquo;&rsquo; should always
be defined as GR. Other sets can be defined either as GL or
GR.</small></p>

<a name="6. Non-Standard Character Set Encodings"></a>
<h2>6. Non-Standard Character Set Encodings</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Character
set encodings that are not in the list of approved standard
encodings can be included using &lsquo;&lsquo;extended
segments&rsquo;&rsquo;. An extended segment begins with one
of the following sequences:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext8.png" alt="Image ctext8.png"></small></p>

<p valign="top"><small>[This uses the &lsquo;&lsquo;other
coding system&rsquo;&rsquo; of ISO 2022, using private Final
characters.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The
&lsquo;&lsquo;M&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;L&rsquo;&rsquo; octets represent a 14-bit
unsigned value giving the number of octets that appear in
the remainder of the segment. The number is computed as ((M
- 128) * 128) + (L - 128). The most significant bit M and L
are always set to one. The remainder of the segment consists
of two parts, the name of the character set encoding and the
actual text. The name of the encoding comes first and is
separated from the text by the octet 00/02 (STX, START OF
TEXT). Note that the length defined by M and L includes the
encoding name and separator.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[The
encoding of the length is chosen to avoid having zero octets
in Compound Text when possible, because embedded NUL values
are problematic in many C language routines. The use of zero
octets cannot be ruled out entirely however, since some
octets in the actual text of the extended segment may have
to be zero.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The name of
the encoding should be registered with the X Consortium to
avoid conflicts and should when appropriate match the
CharSet Registry and Encoding registration used in the X
Logical Font Description. The name itself should be encoded
using ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1), should not use question mark
(03/15) or asterisk (02/10), and should use hyphen (02/13)
only in accordance with the X Logical Font
Description.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Extended
segments are not to be used for any character set encoding
that can be constructed from a GL/GR pair of approved
standard encodings. For example, it is incorrect to use an
extended segment for any of the ISO 8859 family of
encodings.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>It should be
noted that the contents of an extended segment are
arbitrary; for example, they may contain octets in the C0
and C1 ranges, including 00/00, and octets comprising a
given character may differ in their most significant
bit.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[Except for
UTF-8, ISO-registered &lsquo;&lsquo;other coding
systems&rsquo;&rsquo; are not used in Compound Text;
extended segments are the only mechanism for non-2022
encodings.]</small></p>

<a name="7. The UTF-8 encoding"></a>
<h2>7. The UTF-8 encoding</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Unicode
characters that are not contained in one of the approved
standard encodings can be encoded using the UTF-8 encoding.
The following escape sequences are used:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext9.png" alt="Image ctext9.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The first is
the ISO registered sequence for UTF-8 (ISO-IR-196), the
second is the ISO-2022 &lsquo;&lsquo;standard
return&rsquo;&rsquo; sequence. While in UTF-8 mode, the
UTF-8 encoding replaces the currently designated GL and GR
encodings. After return from UTF-8 mode, the previously
designated GL and GR encodings are reactivated.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[This is the
only &lsquo;&lsquo;other coding system&rsquo;&rsquo; used in
Compound Text.]</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[This is an
XFree86 extension introduced in XFree86 4.0.2.]</small></p>

<a name="8. Directionality"></a>
<h2>8. Directionality</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>If desired,
horizontal text direction can be indicated using the
following control sequences:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext10.png" alt="Image ctext10.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>[This is a
subset of the SDS (START DIRECTED STRING) control in the
Draft Bidirectional Addendum to ISO 6429.]</small></p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Directionality
can be nested. Logically, a stack of directions is
maintained. Each of the first two control sequences pushes a
new direction on the stack, and the third sequence (revert)
pops a direction from the stack. The stack starts out empty
at the beginning of a Compound Text string. When the stack
is empty, the directionality of the text is
unspecified.</small></p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Directionality
applies to all subsequent text, whether in GL, GR, or an
extended segment. If the desired directionality of GL, GR,
or extended segments differs, then directionality control
sequences must be inserted when switching between
them.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Note that
definition of GL and GR sets is independent of
directionality; defining a new GL or GR set does not change
the current directionality, and pushing or popping a
directionality does not change the current GL and GR
definitions.</small></p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Specification
of directionality is entirely optional; text direction
should be clear from context in most cases. However, it must
be the case that either all characters in a Compound Text
string have explicitly specified direction or that all
characters have unspecified direction. That is, if
directionality control sequences are used, the first such
control sequence must precede the first graphic character in
a Compound Text string, and graphic characters are not
permitted whenever the directionality stack is
empty.</small></p>

<a name="9. Resources"></a>
<h2>9. Resources</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>To use
Compound Text in a resource, you can simply treat all octets
as if they were ASCII/Latin-1 and just replace all
&lsquo;&lsquo;\&rsquo;&rsquo; octets (05/12) with the two
octets &lsquo;&lsquo;\\&rsquo;&rsquo;, all newline octets
(00/10) with the two octets &lsquo;&lsquo;\n&rsquo;&rsquo;,
and all zero octets with the four octets
&lsquo;&lsquo;\000&rsquo;&rsquo;. It is up to the client
making use of the resource to interpret the data as Compound
Text; the policy by which this is ascertained is not
constrained by the Compound Text specification.</small></p>

<a name="10. Font Names"></a>
<h2>10. Font Names</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>The
following CharSet names for the standard character set
encodings are registered for use in font names under the X
Logical Font Description:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext11.png" alt="Image ctext11.png"></small></p>

<a name="11. Extensions"></a>
<h2>11. Extensions</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>There is no
absolute requirement for a parser to deal with anything but
the particular encoding syntax defined in this
specification. However, it is possible that Compound Text
may be extended in the future, and as such it may be
desirable to construct the parser to handle 2022/6429 syntax
more generally.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>There are
two general formats covering all control sequences that are
expected to appear in extensions:</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>01/11 {I}
F</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><small>For this
format, I is always in the range 02/00 to 02/15, and F is
always in the range 03/00 to 07/14.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>09/11 {P}
{I} F</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><small>For this
format, P is always in the range 03/00 to 03/15, I is always
in the range 02/00 to 02/15, and F is always in the range
04/00 to 07/14.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>In addition,
new (singleton) control characters (in the C0 and C1 ranges)
might be defined in the future.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>Finally, new
kinds of &lsquo;&lsquo;segments&rsquo;&rsquo; might be
defined in the future using syntax similar to extended
segments:</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>01/11 02/05
02/15 F M L</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:8%; margin-top: 1em"><small>For this
format, F is in the range 03/05 to 3/15. M and L are as
defined in extended segments. Such a segment will always be
followed by the number of octets defined by M and L. These
octets can have arbitrary values and need not follow the
internal structure defined for current extended
segments.</small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>If
extensions to this specification are defined in the future,
then any string incorporating instances of such extensions
must start with one of the following control
sequences:</small></p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small><img src="ctext12.png" alt="Image ctext12.png"></small></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>In either
case, V is in the range 02/00 to 02/15 and indicates the
major version minus one of the specification being used.
These version control sequences are for use by clients that
implement earlier versions, but have implemented a general
parser. The first control sequence indicates that it is
acceptable to ignore all extension control sequences; no
mandatory information will be lost in the process. The
second control sequence indicates that it is unacceptable to
ignore any extension control sequences; mandatory
information would be lost in the process. In general, it
will be up to the client generating the Compound Text to
decide which control sequence to use.</small></p>

<a name="12. Errors"></a>
<h2>12. Errors</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><small>If a
Compound Text string does not match the specification here
(e.g., uses undefined control characters, or undefined
control sequences, or incorrectly formatted extended
segments), it is best to treat the entire string as invalid,
except as indicated by a version control
sequence.</small></p>
