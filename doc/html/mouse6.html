<p>In all of the examples below, it is assumed that <code>/dev/mouse</code> is
a link to the appropriate serial port or PS/2 mouse device.</p>

<H3><A NAME="27"></A>6.1. MS IntelliMouse  (serial, PS/2) </H3>
<p>This mouse has a wheel which also acts as the button 2 (middle button).
The wheel movement is recognized as the Z axis motion.  
This behavior is not compatible with XFree86 versions prior to 3.3.2,
but is more consistent with the support for other mice with
wheels or rollers. 
If you want to make the wheel behave like before,
you can use the <code>"ZAxisMapping"</code> option as described above. </p>
<p>IntelliMouse supports the PnP COM device specification.</p>
