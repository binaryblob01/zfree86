XtSetKeyboardFocus - focus events on
a child widget 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Syntax</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt>XtSetKeyboardFocus(Widget <i>subtree</i>, Widget <i>descendant</i>);
 </dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Arguments</a></h2>
</dl>
<p>
Specifies either the widget in the subtree structure which is
to receive the  keyboard event, or  <i>None</i>.   Note that it is not an error
to specify <i>None</i>   when no input focus was previously set. </dl>
<p>
Specifies the
widget for which the keyboard focus is to be set. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
If a future
 <i>KeyPress</i>   or <i>KeyRelease</i>   event occurs within the specified subtree,
<i>XtSetKeyboardFocus</i>   causes <i>XtDispatchEvent</i>   to remap and send the event
to the specified descendant widget. <p>
When there is no modal cascade, keyboard
events can occur within a widget W in one of three ways: </dl>
<p>
W has the X input
focus. </dl>
<p>
W has the keyboard focus of one of its ancestors, and the event occurs
within the ancestor or one of the ancestor's descendants. </dl>
<p>
No ancestor of
W has a descendant within the keyboard focus, and the pointer is within
W. <p>
When there is a modal cascade, a widget W receives keyboard events if
an ancestor of W is in the active subset of the modal cascade and one or
more of the previous conditions is <i>True</i>.   <p>
When subtree or one of its descendants
acquires the X input focus or the pointer moves into the subtree such that
keyboard events would now be delivered to subtree, a <i>FocusIn</i>   event is
generated for the descendant if <i>FocusNotify</i>   events have been selected
by the descendant. Similarly, when W loses the X input focus or the keyboard
focus for one of its ancestors, a <i>FocusOut</i>   event is generated for descendant
if <i>FocusNotify</i>   events have been selected by the descendant.
