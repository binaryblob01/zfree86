  <H2><A NAME="2"></A>2. Supported Chips </H2>

<p>The Chips and Technologies chipsets supported by this driver have one
of three basic architectures. A basic architecture, the WinGine architecture
which is a modification on this basic architecture and a completely new
HiQV architecture.</p>

<H3><A NAME="3"></A>2.1. Basic architecture</H3>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>ct65520</b><dd><p>(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 68MHz@5V)</p>
<dt><b>ct65525</b><dd><p>This chip is basically identical to the 65530. It has the same
ID and is identified as a 65530 when probed. See ct65530 for
details.</p>
<dt><b>ct65530</b><dd><p>This is a very similar chip to the 65520. However it additionally
has the ability for mixed 5V and 3.3V operation and linear addressing
of the video memory.
(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 56MHz@3.3V, 68MHz@5V)</p>
<dt><b>ct65535</b><dd><p>This is the first chip of the ct655xx series to support fully
programmable clocks. Otherwise it has the the same properties
as the 65530.</p>
<dt><b>ct65540</b><dd><p>This is the first version of the of the ct655xx that was capable
of supporting Hi-Color and True-Color. It also includes a fully
programmable dot clock and supports all types of flat panels.
(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 56MHz@3.3V, 68MHz@5V)</p>
<dt><b>ct65545</b><dd><p>The chip is very similar to the 65540, with the addition of H/W
cursor, pop-menu acceleration, BitBLT and support of PCI Buses.
PCI version also allow all the BitBLT and H/W cursor registers
to be memory mapped 2Mb above the Base Address.
(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 56MHz@3.3V,68MHz@5V)</p>
<dt><b>ct65546</b><dd><p>This chip is specially manufactured for Toshiba, and so documentation
is not widely available. It is believed that this is really just a
65545 with a higher maximum dot-clock of 80MHz.
(Max Ram: 1Mb?, Max Dclk: 80MHz?)</p>
<dt><b>ct65548</b><dd><p>This chip is similar to the 65545, but it also includes XRAM support
and supports the higher dot clocks of the 65546. 
(Max Ram: 1Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz)</p>
</dl>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="4"></A>2.2. WinGine architecture</H3>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>ct64200</b><dd><p>This chip, also known as the WinGine, is used in video cards
for desktop systems. It often uses external DAC's and programmable
clock chips to supply additional functionally. None of these are
currently supported within the driver itself, so many cards will only
have limited support. Linear addressing is not supported for this
card in the driver.
(Max Ram: 2Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz)</p>
<dt><b>ct64300</b><dd><p>This is a more advanced version of the WinGine chip, with specification
very similar to the 6554x series of chips. However there are many
differences at a register level. A similar level of acceleration to
the 65545 is included for this driver.
(Max Ram: 2Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz)</p>
</dl>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="5"></A>2.3. HiQV Architecture</H3>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>ct65550</b><dd><p>This chip includes many new features, including improved BitBLT
support (24bpp colour expansion, wider maximum pitch, etc), Multimedia
unit (video capture, zoom video port, etc) and 24bpp uncompressed true
colour (i.e 32bpp mode). Also memory mapped I/O is possible on all bus
configurations. 
(Max Ram: 2Mb, Max Dclk: 80MHz@3.3V,100MHz@5V)</p>
<dt><b>ct65554</b><dd><p>This chip is similar to the 65550 but has a 64bit memory bus as 
opposed to a 32bit bus. It also has higher limits on the maximum
memory and pixel clocks
(Max Ram: 4Mb, Max Dclk: 100MHz@3.3V)</p>
<dt><b>ct65555</b><dd><p>Similar to the 65554 but has yet higher maximum memory and pixel
clocks. It also includes a new DSTN dithering scheme that improves
the performance of DSTN screens.
(Max Ram: 4Mb, Max Dclk: 110MHz@3.3V)</p>
<dt><b>ct68554</b><dd><p>Similar to the 65555 but also incorporates "PanelLink" drivers. This
serial link allows an LCD screens to be located up to 100m from the 
video processor. Expect to see this chip soon in LCD desktop machines
(Max Ram: 4Mb, Max Dclk: 110MHz@3.3V)</p>
<dt><b>ct69000</b><dd><p>Similar to the 65555 but incorporates 2Mbytes of SGRAM on chip. It is
the first Chips and Technologies chipset where all of the registers
are accessible through MMIO, rather than just the BitBlt registers.
(Max Ram: 2Mb Only, Max Dclk: 130MHz@3.3V)</p>
<dt><b>ct69030</b><dd><p>Similar to the 69000 but incorporates 4Mbytes of SGRAM on chip and has
faster memory and pixel clock limits. Also includes a second display
channel so that the CRT can display independently of the LCD.
(Max Ram: 4Mb Only, Max Dclk: 170MHz@3.3V)</p>
