This corresponds to the JIS/ISO method of indexing2-byte characters. It is expected that most large fontswill be defined with 2-byte matrix indexing. For largefonts constructed with linear indexing, a CHAR2B can beinterpreted as a 16-bit number by treating byte1 as the mostsignificant byte. This means that clients should alwaystransmit such 16-bit character values most significant bytefirst, as the server will never byte-swap CHAR2B quantities.The length, format, and interpretation of a HOST address arespecific to the family (see ChangeHosts request).4. ErrorsIn general, when a request terminates with an error, therequest has no side effects (that is, there is no partialexecution). The only requests for which this is not trueare ChangeWindowAttributes, ChangeGC, PolyText8, PolyText16,FreeColors, StoreColors, and ChangeKeyboardControl.The following error codes result from various requests asfollows: NoteThe Atom, Colormap, Cursor, Drawable, Font,GContext, Pixmap, and Window errors are also usedwhen the argument type is extended by union with aset of fixed alternatives, for example, &lt;WINDOW orPointerRoot or None&gt;.5. KeyboardsA KEYCODE represents a physical (or logical) key. Keycodeslie in the inclusive range [8,255]. A keycode value carriesno intrinsic information, although server implementors mayattempt to encode geometry information (for example, matrix)to be interpreted in a server-dependent fashion. Themapping between keys and keycodes cannot be changed usingthe protocol.A KEYSYM is an encoding of a symbol on the cap of a key.The set of defined KEYSYMs include the character setsLatin-1, Latin-2, Latin-3, Latin-4, Kana, Arabic, Cyrillic,Greek, Tech, Special, Publish, APL, Hebrew, Thai, and Koreanas well as a set of symbols common on keyboards (Return,Help, Tab, and so on). KEYSYMs with the most significantbit (of the 29 bits) set are reserved as vendor-specific.A list of KEYSYMs is associated with each KEYCODE. The listis intended to convey the set of symbols on thecorresponding key. If the list (ignoring trailing NoSymbolentries) is a single KEYSYM &lsquo;&lsquo;K&rsquo;&rsquo;, then the list is treatedas if it were the list &lsquo;&lsquo;K NoSymbol K NoSymbol&rsquo;&rsquo;. If thelist (ignoring trailing NoSymbol entries) is a pair ofKEYSYMs &lsquo;&lsquo;K1 K2&rsquo;&rsquo;, then the list is treated as if it werethe list &lsquo;&lsquo;K1 K2 K1 K2&rsquo;&rsquo;. If the list (ignoring trailingNoSymbol entries) is a triple of KEYSYMs &lsquo;&lsquo;K1 K2 K3&rsquo;&rsquo;, thenthe list is treated as if it were the list &lsquo;&lsquo;K1 K2 K3NoSymbol&rsquo;&rsquo;. When an explicit &lsquo;&lsquo;void&rsquo;&rsquo; element is desired inthe list, the value VoidSymbol can be used.The first four elements of the list are split into twogroups of KEYSYMs. Group 1 contains the first and secondKEYSYMs, Group 2 contains the third and fourth KEYSYMs.Within each group, if the second element of the group isNoSymbol, then the group should be treated as if the secondelement were the same as the first element, except when thefirst element is an alphabetic KEYSYM &lsquo;&lsquo;K&rsquo;&rsquo; for which bothlowercase and uppercase forms are defined. In that case,the group should be treated as if the first element were thelowercase form of &lsquo;&lsquo;K&rsquo;&rsquo; and the second element were theuppercase form of &lsquo;&lsquo;K&rsquo;&rsquo;.The standard rules for obtaining a KEYSYM from a KeyPressevent make use of only the Group 1 and Group 2 KEYSYMs; nointerpretation of other KEYSYMs in the list is defined. Themodifier state determines which group to use. Switchingbetween groups is controlled by the KEYSYM named MODESWITCH, by attaching that KEYSYM to some KEYCODE andattaching that KEYCODE to any one of the modifiers Mod1through Mod5. This modifier is called the &lsquo;&lsquo;groupmodifier&rsquo;&rsquo;. For any KEYCODE, Group 1 is used when the groupmodifier is off, and Group 2 is used when the group modifieris on.The Lock modifier is interpreted as CapsLock when the KEYSYMnamed CAPS LOCK is attached to some KEYCODE and that KEYCODEis attached to the Lock modifier. The Lock modifier isinterpreted as ShiftLock when the KEYSYM named SHIFT LOCK isattached to some KEYCODE and that KEYCODE is attached to theLock modifier. If the Lock modifier could be interpreted asboth CapsLock and ShiftLock, the CapsLock interpretation isused.The operation of &lsquo;&lsquo;keypad&rsquo;&rsquo; keys is controlled by the KEYSYMnamed NUM LOCK, by attaching that KEYSYM to some KEYCODE andattaching that KEYCODE to any one of the modifiers Mod1through Mod5. This modifier is called the &lsquo;&lsquo;numlockmodifier&rsquo;&rsquo;. The standard KEYSYMs with the prefix KEYPAD intheir name are called &lsquo;&lsquo;keypad&rsquo;&rsquo; KEYSYMs; these are KEYSYMSwith numeric value in the hexadecimal range #xFF80 to #xFFBDinclusive. In addition, vendor-specific KEYSYMS in thehexadecimal range #x11000000 to #x1100FFFF are also keypadKEYSYMs.Within a group, the choice of KEYSYM is determined byapplying the first rule that is satisfied from the followinglist:&bull; The numlock modifier is on and the second KEYSYM is akeypad KEYSYM. In this case, if the Shift modifier ison, or if the Lock modifier is on and is interpreted asShiftLock, then the first KEYSYM is used; otherwise,the second KEYSYM is used.&bull; The Shift and Lock modifiers are both off. In thiscase, the first KEYSYM is used.&bull; The Shift modifier is off, and the Lock modifier is onand is interpreted as CapsLock. In this case, thefirst KEYSYM is used, but if that KEYSYM is lowercasealphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase KEYSYM isused instead.&bull; The Shift modifier is on, and the Lock modifier is onand is interpreted as CapsLock. In this case, thesecond KEYSYM is used, but if that KEYSYM is lowercasealphabetic, then the corresponding uppercase KEYSYM isused instead.&bull; The Shift modifier is on, or the Lock modifier is onand is interpreted as ShiftLock, or both. In thiscase, the second KEYSYM is used.The mapping between KEYCODEs and KEYSYMs is not useddirectly by the server; it is merely stored for reading andwriting by clients.6. PointersButtons are always numbered starting with one.7. Predefined AtomsPredefined atoms are not strictly necessary and may not beuseful in all environments, but they will eliminate manyInternAtom requests in most applications. Note that theyare predefined only in the sense of having numeric values,not in the sense of having required semantics. The coreprotocol imposes no semantics on these names, but semanticsare specified in other X.Org standards, such as theInter-Client Communication Conventions Manual and the XLogical Font Description Conventions.The following names have predefined atom values. Note thatuppercase and lowercase matter.To avoid conflicts with possible future names for whichsemantics might be imposed (either at the protocol level orin terms of higher level user interface models), namesbeginning with an underscore should be used for atoms thatare private to a particular vendor or organization. Toguarantee no conflicts between vendors and organizations,additional prefixes need to be used. However, the protocoldoes not define the mechanism for choosing such prefixes.For names private to a single application or end user butstored in globally accessible locations, it is suggestedthat two leading underscores be used to avoid conflicts withother names.8.

Requests__&#9474; CreateWindowwid, parent: WINDOWclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly, CopyFromParent}depth: CARD8visual: VISUALID or CopyFromParentx, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16value-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Colormap, Cursor, IDChoice, Match, Pixmap,Value, Window&#9474;__ This request creates an unmapped window and assigns theidentifier wid to it.A class of CopyFromParent means the class is taken from theparent. A depth of zero for class InputOutput orCopyFromParent means the depth is taken from the parent. Avisual of CopyFromParent means the visual type is taken fromthe parent. For class InputOutput, the visual type anddepth must be a combination supported for the screen (or aMatch error results). The depth need not be the same as theparent, but the parent must not be of class InputOnly (or aMatch error results). For class InputOnly, the depth mustbe zero (or a Match error results), and the visual must beone supported for the screen (or a Match error results).However, the parent can have any depth and class.The server essentially acts as if InputOnly windows do notexist for the purposes of graphics requests, exposureprocessing, and VisibilityNotify events. An InputOnlywindow cannot be used as a drawable (as a source ordestination for graphics requests). InputOnly andInputOutput windows act identically in otherrespects&minus;properties, grabs, input control, and so on.The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Yaxis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-leftcorner. Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, andcoincide with pixel centers. Each window and pixmap has itsown coordinate system. For a window, the origin is insidethe border at the inside, upper-left corner.The x and y coordinates for the window are relative to theparent&rsquo;s origin and specify the position of the upper-leftouter corner of the window (not the origin). The width andheight specify the inside size (not including the border)and must be nonzero (or a Value error results). Theborder-width for an InputOnly window must be zero (or aMatch error results).The window is placed on top in the stacking order withrespect to siblings.The value-mask and value-list specify attributes of thewindow that are to be explicitly initialized. The possiblevalues are:The default values when attributes are not explicitlyinitialized are:Only the following attributes are defined for InputOnlywindows:&bull; win-gravity&bull; event-mask&bull; do-not-propagate-mask&bull; override-redirect&bull; cursorIt is a Match error to specify any other attributes forInputOnly windows.If background-pixmap is given, it overrides the defaultbackground-pixmap. The background pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If background None is specified,the window has no defined background. If backgroundParentRelative is specified, the parent&rsquo;s background isused, but the window must have the same depth as the parent(or a Match error results). If the parent has backgroundNone, then the window will also have background None. Acopy of the parent&rsquo;s background is not made. The parent&rsquo;sbackground is reexamined each time the window background isrequired. If background-pixel is given, it overrides thedefault background-pixmap and any background-pixmap givenexplicitly, and a pixmap of undefined size filled withbackground-pixel is used for the background. Range checkingis not performed on the background-pixel value; it is simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits. For aParentRelative background, the background tile origin alwaysaligns with the parent&rsquo;s background tile origin. Otherwise,the background tile origin is always the window origin.When no valid contents are available for regions of a windowand the regions are either visible or the server ismaintaining backing store, the server automatically tilesthe regions with the window&rsquo;s background unless the windowhas a background of None. If the background is None, theprevious screen contents from other windows of the samedepth as the window are simply left in place if the contentscome from the parent of the window or an inferior of theparent; otherwise, the initial contents of the exposedregions are undefined. Exposure events are then generatedfor the regions, even if the background is None.The border tile origin is always the same as the backgroundtile origin. If border-pixmap is given, it overrides thedefault border-pixmap. The border pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If CopyFromParent is given, theparent&rsquo;s border pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to theparent&rsquo;s border attribute do not affect the child), but thewindow must have the same depth as the parent (or a Matcherror results). The pixmap might be copied by sharing thesame pixmap object between the child and parent or by makinga complete copy of the pixmap contents. If border-pixel isgiven, it overrides the default border-pixmap and anyborder-pixmap given explicitly, and a pixmap of undefinedsize filled with border-pixel is used for the border. Rangechecking is not performed on the border-pixel value; it issimply truncated to the appropriate number of bits.Output to a window is always clipped to the inside of thewindow, so that the border is never affected.The bit-gravity defines which region of the window should beretained if the window is resized, and win-gravity defineshow the window should be repositioned if the parent isresized (see ConfigureWindow request).A backing-store of WhenMapped advises the server thatmaintaining contents of obscured regions when the window ismapped would be beneficial. A backing-store of Alwaysadvises the server that maintaining contents even when thewindow is unmapped would be beneficial. In this case, theserver may generate an exposure event when the window iscreated. A value of NotUseful advises the server thatmaintaining contents is unnecessary, although a server maystill choose to maintain contents while the window ismapped. Note that if the server maintains contents, thenthe server should maintain complete contents not just theregion within the parent boundaries, even if the window islarger than its parent. While the server maintainscontents, exposure events will not normally be generated,but the server may stop maintaining contents at any time.If save-under is True, the server is advised that when thiswindow is mapped, saving the contents of windows it obscureswould be beneficial.When the contents of obscured regions of a window are beingmaintained, regions obscured by noninferior windows areincluded in the destination (and source, when the window isthe source) of graphics requests, but regions obscured byinferior windows are not included.The backing-planes indicates (with bits set to 1) which bitplanes of the window hold dynamic data that must bepreserved in backing-stores and during save-unders. Thebacking-pixel specifies what value to use in planes notcovered by backing-planes. The server is free to save onlythe specified bit planes in the backing-store or save-underand regenerate the remaining planes with the specified pixelvalue. Any bits beyond the specified depth of the window inthese values are simply ignored.The event-mask defines which events the client is interestedin for this window (or for some event types, inferiors ofthe window). The do-not-propagate-mask defines which eventsshould not be propagated to ancestor windows when no clienthas the event type selected in this window.The override-redirect specifies whether map and configurerequests on this window should override aSubstructureRedirect on the parent, typically to inform awindow manager not to tamper with the window.The colormap specifies the colormap that best reflects thetrue colors of the window. Servers capable of supportingmultiple hardware colormaps may use this information, andwindow managers may use it for InstallColormap requests.The colormap must have the same visual type and root as thewindow (or a Match error results). If CopyFromParent isspecified, the parent&rsquo;s colormap is copied (subsequentchanges to the parent&rsquo;s colormap attribute do not affect thechild). However, the window must have the same visual typeas the parent (or a Match error results), and the parentmust not have a colormap of None (or a Match error results).For an explanation of None, see FreeColormap request. Thecolormap is copied by sharing the colormap object betweenthe child and the parent, not by making a complete copy ofthe colormap contents.If a cursor is specified, it will be used whenever thepointer is in the window. If None is specified, theparent&rsquo;s cursor will be used when the pointer is in thewindow, and any change in the parent&rsquo;s cursor will cause animmediate change in the displayed cursor.This request generates a CreateNotify event.The background and border pixmaps and the cursor may befreed immediately if no further explicit references to themare to be made.Subsequent drawing into the background or border pixmap hasan undefined effect on the window state. The server mightor might not make a copy of the pixmap.__&#9474; ChangeWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Access, Colormap, Cursor, Match, Pixmap, Value,Window&#9474;__ The value-mask and value-list specify which attributes areto be changed. The values and restrictions are the same asfor CreateWindow.Setting a new background, whether by background-pixmap orbackground-pixel, overrides any previous background.Setting a new border, whether by border-pixel orborder-pixmap, overrides any previous border.Changing the background does not cause the window contentsto be changed. Setting the border or changing thebackground such that the border tile origin changes causesthe border to be repainted. Changing the background of aroot window to None or ParentRelative restores the defaultbackground pixmap. Changing the border of a root window toCopyFromParent restores the default border pixmap.Changing the win-gravity does not affect the currentposition of the window.Changing the backing-store of an obscured window toWhenMapped or Always or changing the backing-planes,backing-pixel, or save-under of a mapped window may have noimmediate effect.Multiple clients can select input on the same window; theirevent-masks are disjoint. When an event is generated, itwill be reported to all interested clients. However, onlyone client at a time can select for SubstructureRedirect,only one client at a time can select for ResizeRedirect, andonly one client at a time can select for ButtonPress. Anattempt to violate these restrictions results in an Accesserror.There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, notone per client.Changing the colormap of a window (by defining a new map,not by changing the contents of the existing map) generatesa ColormapNotify event. Changing the colormap of a visiblewindow might have no immediate effect on the screen (seeInstallColormap request).Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores thedefault cursor.The order in which attributes are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of theattributes may have been altered.__&#9474; GetWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOW&rarr;visual: VISUALIDclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly}bit-gravity: BITGRAVITYwin-gravity: WINGRAVITYbacking-store: {NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always}backing-planes: CARD32backing-pixel: CARD32save-under: BOOLcolormap: COLORMAP or Nonemap-is-installed: BOOLmap-state: {Unmapped, Unviewable, Viewable}all-event-masks, your-event-mask: SETofEVENTdo-not-propagate-mask: SETofDEVICEEVENToverride-redirect: BOOLErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request returns the current attributes of the window.A window is Unviewable if it is mapped but some ancestor isunmapped.

The window and all inferiors arethen destroyed, and a DestroyNotify event is generated foreach window. The ordering of the DestroyNotify events issuch that for any given window, DestroyNotify is generatedon all inferiors of the window before being generated on thewindow itself. The ordering among siblings and acrosssubhierarchies is not otherwise constrained.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed.If the window is a root window, this request has no effect.__&#9474; DestroySubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs a DestroyWindow request on allchildren of the window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.__&#9474; ChangeSaveSetwindow: WINDOWmode: {Insert, Delete}Errors:Match, Value, Window&#9474;__ This request adds or removes the specified window from theclient&rsquo;s save-set.

The window is then removed from itscurrent position in the hierarchy and is inserted as a childof the specified parent. The x and y coordinates arerelative to the parent&rsquo;s origin and specify the new positionof the upper-left outer corner of the window. The window isplaced on top in the stacking order with respect tosiblings. A ReparentNotify event is then generated. Theoverride-redirect attribute of the window is passed on inthis event; a value of True indicates that a window managershould not tamper with this window. Finally, if the windowwas originally mapped, a MapWindow request is performedautomatically.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed. The server might not generate exposure eventsfor regions from the initial unmap that are immediatelyobscured by the final map.A Match error is generated if:&bull; The new parent is not on the same screen as the oldparent.&bull; The new parent is the window itself or an inferior ofthe window.&bull; The new parent is InputOnly, and the window is not.&bull; The window has a ParentRelative background, and the newparent is not the same depth as the window.__&#9474; MapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already mapped, this request has no effect.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, then a MapRequest event is generated, but thewindow remains unmapped. Otherwise, the window is mapped,and a MapNotify event is generated.If the window is now viewable and its contents have beendiscarded, the window is tiled with its background (if nobackground is defined, the existing screen contents are notaltered), and zero or more exposure events are generated.If a backing-store has been maintained while the window wasunmapped, no exposure events are generated. If abacking-store will now be maintained, a full-window exposureis always generated. Otherwise, only visible regions may bereported. Similar tiling and exposure take place for anynewly viewable inferiors.__&#9474; MapSubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs a MapWindow request on all unmappedchildren of the window, in top-to-bottom stacking order.__&#9474; UnmapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already unmapped, this request has noeffect. Otherwise, the window is unmapped, and anUnmapNotify event is generated. Normal exposure processingon formerly obscured windows is performed.__&#9474; UnmapSubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs an UnmapWindow request on all mappedchildren of the window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.__&#9474; ConfigureWindowwindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Match, Value, Window&#9474;__ This request changes the configuration of the window. Thevalue-mask and value-list specify which values are to begiven. The possible values are:The x and y coordinates are relative to the parent&rsquo;s originand specify the position of the upper-left outer corner ofthe window. The width and height specify the inside size,not including the border, and must be nonzero (or a Valueerror results). Those values not specified are taken fromthe existing geometry of the window. Note that changingjust the border-width leaves the outer-left corner of thewindow in a fixed position but moves the absolute positionof the window&rsquo;s origin. It is a Match error to attempt tomake the border-width of an InputOnly window nonzero.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, a ConfigureRequest event is generated, and nofurther processing is performed. Otherwise, the followingis performed:If some other client has selected ResizeRedirect on thewindow and the inside width or height of the window is beingchanged, a ResizeRequest event is generated, and the currentinside width and height are used instead. Note that theoverride-redirect attribute of the window has no effect onResizeRedirect and that SubstructureRedirect on the parenthas precedence over ResizeRedirect on the window.The geometry of the window is changed as specified, thewindow is restacked among siblings, and a ConfigureNotifyevent is generated if the state of the window actuallychanges. If the inside width or height of the window hasactually changed, then children of the window are affected,according to their win-gravity. Exposure processing isperformed on formerly obscured windows (including the windowitself and its inferiors if regions of them were obscuredbut now are not). Exposure processing is also performed onany new regions of the window (as a result of increasing thewidth or height) and on any regions where window contentsare lost.If the inside width or height of a window is not changed butthe window is moved or its border is changed, then thecontents of the window are not lost but move with thewindow. Changing the inside width or height of the windowcauses its contents to be moved or lost, depending on thebit-gravity of the window. It also causes children to bereconfigured, depending on their win-gravity. For a changeof width and height of W and H, we define the [x, y] pairsas:When a window with one of these bit-gravities is resized,the corresponding pair defines the change in position ofeach pixel in the window. When a window with one of thesewin-gravities has its parent window resized, thecorresponding pair defines the change in position of thewindow within the parent. This repositioning generates aGravityNotify event. GravityNotify events are generatedafter the ConfigureNotify event is generated.A gravity of Static indicates that the contents or originshould not move relative to the origin of the root window.If the change in size of the window is coupled with a changein position of [X, Y], then for bit-gravity the change inposition of each pixel is [&minus;X, &minus;Y] and for win-gravity thechange in position of a child when its parent is so resizedis [&minus;X, &minus;Y]. Note that Static gravity still only takeseffect when the width or height of the window is changed,not when the window is simply moved.A bit-gravity of Forget indicates that the window contentsare always discarded after a size change, even ifbacking-store or save-under has been requested. The windowis tiled with its background (except, if no background isdefined, the existing screen contents are not altered) andzero or more exposure events are generated.The contents and borders of inferiors are not affected bytheir parent&rsquo;s bit-gravity. A server is permitted to ignorethe specified bit-gravity and use Forget instead.A win-gravity of Unmap is like NorthWest, but the child isalso unmapped when the parent is resized, and an UnmapNotifyevent is generated. UnmapNotify events are generated afterthe ConfigureNotify event is generated.If a sibling and a stack-mode are specified, the window isrestacked as follows:If a stack-mode is specified but no sibling is specified,the window is restacked as follows:It is a Match error if a sibling is specified without astack-mode or if the window is not actually a sibling.Note that the computations for BottomIf, TopIf, and Oppositeare performed with respect to the window&rsquo;s final geometry(as controlled by the other arguments to the request), notto its initial geometry.Attempts to configure a root window have no effect.__&#9474; CirculateWindowwindow: WINDOWdirection: {RaiseLowest, LowerHighest}Errors: Value, Window&#9474;__ If some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe window, then a CirculateRequest event is generated, andno further processing is performed. Otherwise, thefollowing is performed, and then a CirculateNotify event isgenerated if the window is actually restacked.For RaiseLowest, CirculateWindow raises the lowest mappedchild (if any) that is occluded by another child to the topof the stack. For LowerHighest, CirculateWindow lowers thehighest mapped child (if any) that occludes another child tothe bottom of the stack. Exposure processing is performedon formerly obscured windows.__&#9474; GetGeometrydrawable: DRAWABLE&rarr;root: WINDOWdepth: CARD8x, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16Errors: Drawable&#9474;__ This request returns the root and current geometry of thedrawable.

The gcontext can be used with anydestination drawable having the same root and depth as thespecified drawable; use with other drawables results in aMatch error.The value-mask and value-list specify which components areto be explicitly initialized. The context components are:&nbsp;&nbsp;In graphics operations, given a source and destinationpixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bitsof the pixels; that is, a Boolean operation is performed ineach bit plane. The plane-mask restricts the operation to asubset of planes, so the result is:((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))Range checking is not performed on the values forforeground, background, or plane-mask. They are simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits.The meanings of the functions are:The line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater thanor equal to one, a wide line, or the special value zero, athin line.Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by thegraphics request. Unless otherwise specified by the join orcap style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints[x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle with verticesat the following real coordinates:[x1&minus;(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1&minus;(w*cs/2)],[x2&minus;(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2&minus;(w*cs/2)]The sn is the sine of the angle of the line and cs is thecosine of the angle of the line. A pixel is part of theline (and hence drawn) if the center of the pixel is fullyinside the bounding box, which is viewed as havinginfinitely thin edges. If the center of the pixel isexactly on the bounding box, it is part of the line if andonly if the interior is immediately to its right (xincreasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontaledge are a special case and are part of the line if and onlyif the interior or the boundary is immediately below (yincreasing direction) and if the interior or the boundary isimmediately to the right (x increasing direction). Notethat this description is a mathematical model describing thepixels that are drawn for a wide line and does not implythat trigonometry is required to implement such a model.Real or fixed point arithmetic is recommended for computingthe corners of the line endpoints for lines greater than onepixel in width.Thin lines (zero line-width) are nominally one pixel widelines drawn using an unspecified, device-dependentalgorithm. There are only two constraints on thisalgorithm. First, if a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1]to [x2,y2] and another line is drawn unclipped from[x1+dx,y1+dy] to [x2+dx,y2+dy], then a point [x,y] istouched by drawing the first line if and only if the point[x+dx,y+dy] is touched by drawing the second line. Second,the effective set of points comprising a line cannot beaffected by clipping. Thus, a point is touched in a clippedline if and only if the point lies inside the clippingregion and the point would be touched by the line when drawnunclipped.Note that a wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] alwaysdraws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to[x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style.Implementors are encouraged to make this property true forthin lines, but it is not required. A line-width of zeromay differ from a line-width of one in which pixels aredrawn. In general, drawing a thin line will be faster thandrawing a wide line of width one, but thin lines may not mixwell aesthetically with wide lines because of the differentdrawing algorithms. If it is desirable to obtain preciseand uniform results across all displays, a client shouldalways use a line-width of one, rather than a line-width ofzero.The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the semanticsdepends on the line-width and the cap-style:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe join-style is applied at one or both endpoints, theeffect is as if the line was removed from the overall path.However, if the total path consists of (or is reduced to) asingle point joined with itself, the effect is the same aswhen the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensionalplane with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions.When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in agraphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instanceof the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within thedrawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. Thetile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative tothe origin of whatever destination drawable is specified ina graphics request.The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as thegcontext (or a Match error results). The stipple pixmapmust have depth one and must have the same root as thegcontext (or a Match error results). For fill-styleStippled (but not fill-style OpaqueStippled), the stipplepattern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an additionalclip mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask. Any size pixmapcan be used for tiling or stippling, although some sizes maybe faster to use than others.The fill-style defines the contents of the source for line,text, and fill requests. For all text and fill requests(for example, PolyText8, PolyText16, PolyFillRectangle,FillPoly, and PolyFillArc) as well as for line requests withline-style Solid, (for example, PolyLine, PolySegment,PolyRectangle, PolyArc) and for the even dashes for linerequests with line-style OnOffDash or DoubleDash:For the odd dashes for line requests with line-styleDoubleDash:The dashes value allowed here is actually a simplified formof the more general patterns that can be set with SetDashes.Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to specifying thetwo element list [N, N] in SetDashes. The value must benonzero (or a Value error results). The meaning ofdash-offset and dashes are explained in the SetDashesrequest.The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable.Only pixels where the clip-mask has bits set to 1 are drawn.Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered by theclip-mask or where the clip-mask has bits set to 0. Theclip-mask affects all graphics requests, but it does notclip sources. The clip-mask origin is interpreted relativeto the origin of whatever destination drawable is specifiedin a graphics request. If a pixmap is specified as theclip-mask, it must have depth 1 and have the same root asthe gcontext (or a Match error results). If clip-mask isNone, then pixels are always drawn, regardless of the cliporigin. The clip-mask can also be set with theSetClipRectangles request.For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows areadditionally clipped by all viewable InputOutput children.For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination windowis clipped by inferiors. This will result in includingsubwindow contents in the source and drawing throughsubwindow boundaries of the destination. The use ofIncludeInferiors with a source or destination window of onedepth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is notillegal, but the semantics is undefined by the coreprotocol.The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (that is, aredrawn) for paths given in FillPoly requests. EvenOdd meansa point is inside if an infinite ray with the point asorigin crosses the path an odd number of times. ForWinding, a point is inside if an infinite ray with the pointas origin crosses an unequal number of clockwise andcounterclockwise directed path segments. A clockwisedirected path segment is one that crosses the ray from leftto right as observed from the point. A counter-clockwisesegment is one that crosses the ray from right to left asobserved from the point. The case where a directed linesegment is coincident with the ray is uninteresting becauseone can simply choose a different ray that is not coincidentwith a segment.For both fill rules, a point is infinitely small and thepath is an infinitely thin line. A pixel is inside if thecenter point of the pixel is inside and the center point isnot on the boundary. If the center point is on theboundary, the pixel is inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately to its right (x increasingdirection). Pixels with centers along a horizontal edge area special case and are inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately below (y increasing direction).The arc-mode controls filling in the PolyFillArc request.The graphics-exposures flag controls GraphicsExposure eventgeneration for CopyArea and CopyPlane requests (and anysimilar requests defined by extensions).The default component values are:Storing a pixmap in a gcontext might or might not result ina copy being made. If the pixmap is later used as thedestination for a graphics request, the change might ormight not be reflected in the gcontext. If the pixmap isused simultaneously in a graphics request as both adestination and as a tile or stipple, the results are notdefined.It is quite likely that some amount of gcontext informationwill be cached in display hardware and that such hardwarecan only cache a small number of gcontexts. Given thenumber and complexity of components, clients should viewswitching between gcontexts with nearly identical state assignificantly more expensive than making minor changes to asingle gcontext.__&#9474; ChangeGCgc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Font, GContext, Match, Pixmap, Value&#9474;__ This request changes components in gc. The value-mask andvalue-list specify which components are to be changed. Thevalues and restrictions are the same as for CreateGC.Changing the clip-mask also overrides any previousSetClipRectangles request on the context. Changingdash-offset or dashes overrides any previous SetDashesrequest on the context.The order in which components are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of thecomponents may have been altered.__&#9474; CopyGCsrc-gc, dst-gc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKErrors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request copies components from src-gc to dst-gc.

Dashes cannot be empty (or a Value errorresults). Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent tospecifying the same list concatenated with itself to producean even-length list. The initial and alternating elementsof dashes are the even dashes; the others are the odddashes. Each element specifies a dash length in pixels.All of the elements must be nonzero (or a Value errorresults). The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern,specifying how many pixels into dashes the pattern shouldactually begin in any single graphics request. Dashing iscontinuous through path elements combined with a join-stylebut is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence ofjoined lines.The unit of measure for dashes is the same as in theordinary coordinate system. Ideally, a dash length ismeasured along the slope of the line, but implementationsare only required to match this ideal for horizontal andvertical lines. Failing the ideal semantics, it issuggested that the length be measured along the major axisof the line. The major axis is defined as the x axis forlines drawn at an angle of between &minus;45 and +45 degrees orbetween 135 and 225 degrees from the x axis. For all otherlines, the major axis is the y axis.For any graphics primitive, the computation of the endpointof an individual dash only depends on the geometry of theprimitive, the start position of the dash, the direction ofthe dash, and the dash length.For any graphics primitive, the total set of pixels used torender the primitive (both even and odd numbered dashelements) with DoubleDash line-style is the same as the setof pixels used to render the primitive with Solidline-style.For any graphics primitive, if the primitive is drawn withOnOffDash or DoubleDash line-style unclipped at position[x,y] and again at position [x+dx,y+dy], then a point[x1,y1] is included in a dash in the first instance if andonly if the point [x1+dx,y1+dy] is included in the dash inthe second instance. In addition, the effective set ofpoints comprising a dash cannot be affected by clipping. Apoint is included in a clipped dash if and only if the pointlies inside the clipping region and the point would beincluded in the dash when drawn unclipped.__&#9474; SetClipRectanglesgc: GCONTEXTclip-x-origin, clip-y-origin: INT16rectangles: LISTofRECTANGLEordering: {UnSorted, YSorted, YXSorted, YXBanded}Errors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request changes clip-mask in gc to the specified listof rectangles and sets the clip origin.

Each arc isspecified by a rectangle and two angles. The angles aresigned integers in degrees scaled by 64, with positiveindicating counterclockwise motion and negative indicatingclockwise motion. The start of the arc is specified byangle1 relative to the three-o&rsquo;clock position from thecenter of the rectangle, and the path and extent of the arcis specified by angle2 relative to the start of the arc. Ifthe magnitude of angle2 is greater than 360 degrees, it istruncated to 360 degrees. The x and y coordinates of therectangle are relative to the origin of the drawable. Foran arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the origin of the majorand minor axes is at [x+(w/2),y+(h/2)], and the infinitelythin path describing the entire circle/ellipse intersectsthe horizontal axis at [x,y+(h/2)] and [x+w,y+(h/2)] andintersects the vertical axis at [x+(w/2),y] and[x+(w/2),y+h]. These coordinates are not necessarilyintegral; that is, they are not truncated to discretecoordinates.For a wide line with line-width lw, the ideal boundingoutlines for filling are given by the two infinitely thinpaths consisting of all points whose perpendicular distancefrom a tangent to the path of the circle/ellipse is equal tolw/2 (which may be a fractional value). When the width andheight of the arc are not equal and both are nonzero, thenthe actual bounding outlines are implementation dependent.However, the computation of the shape and position of thebounding outlines (relative to the center of the arc) onlydepends on the width and height of the arc and theline-width.The cap-style is applied the same as for a linecorresponding to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at theendpoint.

However, for aButt cap, the face is defined by a straight line, and thecomputation of the position (relative to the center of thearc) and the slope of the line only depends on the width andheight of the arc and the angle of the arc face. For othercap styles, the computation of the position (relative to thecenter of the arc) and the shape of the cap only depends onthe width and height of the arc, the line-width, the angleof the arc face, and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the arc from the endpoint.The join-style is applied the same as for two linescorresponding to the tangents of the circles/ellipses at thejoin point. When the width and height of both arcs arenonzero, and the angle of either arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, then the shape of the join isimplementation dependent. However, the computation of theshape only depends on the width and height of each arc, theline-width, the angles of the two arc faces, the direction(clockwise or counter clockwise) of the arcs from the joinpoint, and the relative orientation of the two arc centerpoints.For an arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the angles must bespecified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of theellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems areidentical). The relationship between these angles andangles expressed in the normal coordinate system of thescreen (as measured with a protractor) is as follows:skewed-angle = atan(tan(normal-angle) * w/h) + adjustThe skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians(rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range [0,2*PI).The atan returns a value in the range [&minus;PI/2,PI/2].

When the access control mechanism isenabled and a client attempts to establish a connection tothe server, the host on which the client resides must be inthe access control list, or the client must have beengranted permission by a server-dependent method, or theserver will refuse the connection.The client must reside on the same host as the server and/orhave been granted permission by a server-dependent method toexecute this request (or an Access error results).An initial access control list can usually be specified,typically by naming a file that the server reads at startupand reset.The following address families are defined. A server is notrequired to support these families and may support familiesnot listed here. Use of an unsupported family, an improperaddress format, or an improper address length within asupported family results in a Value error.Note that use of a host address in the ChangeHosts requestis deprecated. It is only useful when a host has a unique,constant address, a requirement that is increasingly unmetas sites adopt dynamically assigned addresses, networkaddress translation gateways, IPv6 link local addresses, andvarious other technologies. It also assumes all users of ahost share equivalent access rights, and as such has neverbeen suitable for many multi-user machine environments.Instead, more secure forms of authentication, such as thosebased on shared secrets or public key encryption, arerecommended.For the Internet family, the address must be four byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The Internet family supports IP version 4 addresses only.For the InternetV6 family, the address must be sixteen byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The InternetV6 family supports IP version 6 addresses only.For the DECnet family, the server performs no automaticswapping on the address bytes. A Phase IV address is twobytes long: the first byte contains the least significanteight bits of the node number, and the second byte containsthe most significant two bits of the node number in theleast significant two bits of the byte and the area in themost significant six bits of the byte.For the Chaos family, the address must be two bytes long.The host number is always the first byte in the address, andthe subnet number is always the second byte.

Connection CloseAt connection close, all event selections made by the clientare discarded. If the client has the pointer activelygrabbed, an UngrabPointer is performed. If the client hasthe keyboard actively grabbed, an UngrabKeyboard isperformed. All passive grabs by the client are released.If the client has the server grabbed, an UngrabServer isperformed. All selections (see SetSelectionOwner request)owned by the client are disowned. If close-down mode (seeSetCloseDownMode request) is RetainPermanent orRetainTemporary, then all resources (including colormapentries) allocated by the client are marked as permanent ortemporary, respectively (but this does not prevent otherclients from explicitly destroying them). If the mode isDestroy, all of the client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed.When a client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed, for each window inthe client&rsquo;s save-set, if the window is an inferior of awindow created by the client, the save-set window isreparented to the closest ancestor such that the save-setwindow is not an inferior of a window created by the client.If the save-set window is unmapped, a MapWindow request isperformed on it (even if it was not an inferior of a windowcreated by the client). The reparenting leaves unchangedthe absolute coordinates (with respect to the root window)of the upper-left outer corner of the save-set window.After save-set processing, all windows created by the clientare destroyed. For each nonwindow resource created by theclient, the appropriate Free request is performed. Allcolors and colormap entries allocated by the client arefreed.A server goes through a cycle of having no connections andhaving some connections. At every transition to the stateof having no connections as a result of a connection closingwith a Destroy close-down mode, the server resets its stateas if it had just been started. This starts by destroyingall lingering resources from clients that have terminated inRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode. It additionallyincludes deleting all but the predefined atom identifiers,deleting all properties on all root windows, resetting alldevice maps and attributes (key click, bell volume,acceleration), resetting the access control list, restoringthe standard root tiles and cursors, restoring the defaultfont path, and restoring the input focus to statePointerRoot.Note that closing a connection with a close-down mode ofRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary will not cause the serverto reset.11. EventsWhen a button press is processed with the pointer in somewindow W and no active pointer grab is in progress, theancestors of W are searched from the root down, looking fora passive grab to activate. If no matching passive grab onthe button exists, then an active grab is startedautomatically for the client receiving the event, and thelast-pointer-grab time is set to the current server time.The effect is essentially equivalent to a GrabButton witharguments:The grab is terminated automatically when the logical stateof the pointer has all buttons released. UngrabPointer andChangeActivePointerGrab can both be used to modify theactive grab.__&#9474; KeyPressKeyReleaseButtonPressButtonReleaseMotionNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16detail: &lt;see below&gt;state: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ These events are generated either when a key or buttonlogically changes state or when the pointer logically moves.The generation of these logical changes may lag the physicalchanges if device event processing is frozen. Note thatKeyPress and KeyRelease are generated for all keys, eventhose mapped to modifier bits. The source of the event isthe window the pointer is in. The window the event isreported with respect to is called the event window. Theevent window is found by starting with the source window andlooking up the hierarchy for the first window on which anyclient has selected interest in the event (provided nointervening window prohibits event generation by includingthe event type in its do-not-propagate-mask). The actualwindow used for reporting can be modified by active grabsand, in the case of keyboard events, can be modified by thefocus window.The root is the root window of the source window, and root-xand root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;sorigin at the time of the event. Event is the event window.If the event window is on the same screen as root, thenevent-x and event-y are the pointer coordinates relative tothe event window&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-yare zero. If the source window is an inferior of the eventwindow, then child is set to the child of the event windowthat is an ancestor of (or is) the source window.Otherwise, it is set to None. The state component gives thelogical state of the buttons and modifier keys just beforethe event. The detail component type varies with the eventtype:MotionNotify events are only generated when the motionbegins and ends in the window. The granularity of motionevents is not guaranteed, but a client selecting for motionevents is guaranteed to get at least one event when thepointer moves and comes to rest. Selecting PointerMotionreceives events independent of the state of the pointerbuttons. By selecting some subset of Button[1-5]Motioninstead, MotionNotify events will only be received when oneor more of the specified buttons are pressed. By selectingButtonMotion, MotionNotify events will be received only whenat least one button is pressed. The events are always oftype MotionNotify, independent of the selection. IfPointerMotionHint is selected, the server is free to sendonly one MotionNotify event (with detail Hint) to the clientfor the event window until either the key or button statechanges, the pointer leaves the event window, or the clientissues a QueryPointer or GetMotionEvents request.__&#9474; EnterNotifyLeaveNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16mode: {Normal, Grab, Ungrab}detail: {Ancestor, Virtual, Inferior, Nonlinear,NonlinearVirtual}focus: BOOLstate: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ If pointer motion or window hierarchy change causes thepointer to be in a different window than before, EnterNotifyand LeaveNotify events are generated instead of aMotionNotify event. Only clients selecting EnterWindow on awindow receive EnterNotify events, and only clientsselecting LeaveWindow receive LeaveNotify events. Thepointer position reported in the event is always the finalposition, not the initial position of the pointer. The rootis the root window for this position, and root-x and root-yare the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;s origin at thetime of the event. Event is the event window. If the eventwindow is on the same screen as root, then event-x andevent-y are the pointer coordinates relative to the eventwindow&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-y are zero.In a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the event windowcontains the initial position of the pointer, then the childcomponent is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None. Foran EnterNotify event, if a child of the event windowcontains the final pointer position, then the childcomponent is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None. Ifthe event window is the focus window or an inferior of thefocus window, then focus is True.

The format specifies whether the datashould be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bitquantities, so that the server can correctly byte-swap, asnecessary. The data always consists of either 20 8-bitvalues or 10 16-bit values or 5 32-bit values, althoughparticular message types might not make use of all of thesevalues.12. Flow Control and ConcurrencyWhenever the server is writing to a given connection, it ispermissible for the server to stop reading from thatconnection (but if the writing would block, it must continueto service other connections). The server is not requiredto buffer more than a single request per connection at onetime. For a given connection to the server, a client canblock while reading from the connection but should undertaketo read (events and errors) when writing would block.Failure on the part of a client to obey this rule couldresult in a deadlocked connection, although deadlock isprobably unlikely unless either the transport layer has verylittle buffering or the client attempts to send largenumbers of requests without ever reading replies or checkingfor errors and events.Whether or not a server is implemented with internalconcurrency, the overall effect must be as if individualrequests are executed to completion in some serial order,and requests from a given connection must be executed indelivery order (that is, the total execution order is ashuffle of the individual streams). The execution of arequest includes validating all arguments, collecting alldata for any reply, and generating and queueing all requiredevents. However, it does not include the actualtransmission of the reply and the events. In addition, theeffect of any other cause that can generate multiple events(for example, activation of a grab or pointer motion) musteffectively generate and queue all required eventsindivisibly with respect to all other causes and requests.For a request from a given client, any events destined forthat client that are caused by executing the request must besent to the client before any reply or error is sent.1">9. Requests__&#9474; CreateWindowwid, parent: WINDOWclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly, CopyFromParent}depth: CARD8visual: VISUALID or CopyFromParentx, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16value-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Colormap, Cursor, IDChoice, Match, Pixmap,Value, Window&#9474;__ This request creates an unmapped window and assigns theidentifier wid to it.A class of CopyFromParent means the class is taken from theparent. A depth of zero for class InputOutput orCopyFromParent means the depth is taken from the parent. Avisual of CopyFromParent means the visual type is taken fromthe parent. For class InputOutput, the visual type anddepth must be a combination supported for the screen (or aMatch error results). The depth need not be the same as theparent, but the parent must not be of class InputOnly (or aMatch error results). For class InputOnly, the depth mustbe zero (or a Match error results), and the visual must beone supported for the screen (or a Match error results).However, the parent can have any depth and class.The server essentially acts as if InputOnly windows do notexist for the purposes of graphics requests, exposureprocessing, and VisibilityNotify events. An InputOnlywindow cannot be used as a drawable (as a source ordestination for graphics requests). InputOnly andInputOutput windows act identically in otherrespects&minus;properties, grabs, input control, and so on.The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Yaxis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-leftcorner. Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, andcoincide with pixel centers. Each window and pixmap has itsown coordinate system. For a window, the origin is insidethe border at the inside, upper-left corner.The x and y coordinates for the window are relative to theparent&rsquo;s origin and specify the position of the upper-leftouter corner of the window (not the origin). The width andheight specify the inside size (not including the border)and must be nonzero (or a Value error results). Theborder-width for an InputOnly window must be zero (or aMatch error results).The window is placed on top in the stacking order withrespect to siblings.The value-mask and value-list specify attributes of thewindow that are to be explicitly initialized. The possiblevalues are:The default values when attributes are not explicitlyinitialized are:Only the following attributes are defined for InputOnlywindows:&bull; win-gravity&bull; event-mask&bull; do-not-propagate-mask&bull; override-redirect&bull; cursorIt is a Match error to specify any other attributes forInputOnly windows.If background-pixmap is given, it overrides the defaultbackground-pixmap. The background pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If background None is specified,the window has no defined background. If backgroundParentRelative is specified, the parent&rsquo;s background isused, but the window must have the same depth as the parent(or a Match error results). If the parent has backgroundNone, then the window will also have background None. Acopy of the parent&rsquo;s background is not made. The parent&rsquo;sbackground is reexamined each time the window background isrequired. If background-pixel is given, it overrides thedefault background-pixmap and any background-pixmap givenexplicitly, and a pixmap of undefined size filled withbackground-pixel is used for the background. Range checkingis not performed on the background-pixel value; it is simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits. For aParentRelative background, the background tile origin alwaysaligns with the parent&rsquo;s background tile origin. Otherwise,the background tile origin is always the window origin.When no valid contents are available for regions of a windowand the regions are either visible or the server ismaintaining backing store, the server automatically tilesthe regions with the window&rsquo;s background unless the windowhas a background of None. If the background is None, theprevious screen contents from other windows of the samedepth as the window are simply left in place if the contentscome from the parent of the window or an inferior of theparent; otherwise, the initial contents of the exposedregions are undefined. Exposure events are then generatedfor the regions, even if the background is None.The border tile origin is always the same as the backgroundtile origin. If border-pixmap is given, it overrides thedefault border-pixmap. The border pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If CopyFromParent is given, theparent&rsquo;s border pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to theparent&rsquo;s border attribute do not affect the child), but thewindow must have the same depth as the parent (or a Matcherror results). The pixmap might be copied by sharing thesame pixmap object between the child and parent or by makinga complete copy of the pixmap contents. If border-pixel isgiven, it overrides the default border-pixmap and anyborder-pixmap given explicitly, and a pixmap of undefinedsize filled with border-pixel is used for the border. Rangechecking is not performed on the border-pixel value; it issimply truncated to the appropriate number of bits.Output to a window is always clipped to the inside of thewindow, so that the border is never affected.The bit-gravity defines which region of the window should beretained if the window is resized, and win-gravity defineshow the window should be repositioned if the parent isresized (see ConfigureWindow request).A backing-store of WhenMapped advises the server thatmaintaining contents of obscured regions when the window ismapped would be beneficial. A backing-store of Alwaysadvises the server that maintaining contents even when thewindow is unmapped would be beneficial. In this case, theserver may generate an exposure event when the window iscreated. A value of NotUseful advises the server thatmaintaining contents is unnecessary, although a server maystill choose to maintain contents while the window ismapped. Note that if the server maintains contents, thenthe server should maintain complete contents not just theregion within the parent boundaries, even if the window islarger than its parent. While the server maintainscontents, exposure events will not normally be generated,but the server may stop maintaining contents at any time.If save-under is True, the server is advised that when thiswindow is mapped, saving the contents of windows it obscureswould be beneficial.When the contents of obscured regions of a window are beingmaintained, regions obscured by noninferior windows areincluded in the destination (and source, when the window isthe source) of graphics requests, but regions obscured byinferior windows are not included.The backing-planes indicates (with bits set to 1) which bitplanes of the window hold dynamic data that must bepreserved in backing-stores and during save-unders. Thebacking-pixel specifies what value to use in planes notcovered by backing-planes. The server is free to save onlythe specified bit planes in the backing-store or save-underand regenerate the remaining planes with the specified pixelvalue. Any bits beyond the specified depth of the window inthese values are simply ignored.The event-mask defines which events the client is interestedin for this window (or for some event types, inferiors ofthe window). The do-not-propagate-mask defines which eventsshould not be propagated to ancestor windows when no clienthas the event type selected in this window.The override-redirect specifies whether map and configurerequests on this window should override aSubstructureRedirect on the parent, typically to inform awindow manager not to tamper with the window.The colormap specifies the colormap that best reflects thetrue colors of the window. Servers capable of supportingmultiple hardware colormaps may use this information, andwindow managers may use it for InstallColormap requests.The colormap must have the same visual type and root as thewindow (or a Match error results). If CopyFromParent isspecified, the parent&rsquo;s colormap is copied (subsequentchanges to the parent&rsquo;s colormap attribute do not affect thechild). However, the window must have the same visual typeas the parent (or a Match error results), and the parentmust not have a colormap of None (or a Match error results).For an explanation of None, see FreeColormap request. Thecolormap is copied by sharing the colormap object betweenthe child and the parent, not by making a complete copy ofthe colormap contents.If a cursor is specified, it will be used whenever thepointer is in the window. If None is specified, theparent&rsquo;s cursor will be used when the pointer is in thewindow, and any change in the parent&rsquo;s cursor will cause animmediate change in the displayed cursor.This request generates a CreateNotify event.The background and border pixmaps and the cursor may befreed immediately if no further explicit references to themare to be made.Subsequent drawing into the background or border pixmap hasan undefined effect on the window state. The server mightor might not make a copy of the pixmap.__&#9474; ChangeWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Access, Colormap, Cursor, Match, Pixmap, Value,Window&#9474;__ The value-mask and value-list specify which attributes areto be changed. The values and restrictions are the same asfor CreateWindow.Setting a new background, whether by background-pixmap orbackground-pixel, overrides any previous background.Setting a new border, whether by border-pixel orborder-pixmap, overrides any previous border.Changing the background does not cause the window contentsto be changed. Setting the border or changing thebackground such that the border tile origin changes causesthe border to be repainted. Changing the background of aroot window to None or ParentRelative restores the defaultbackground pixmap. Changing the border of a root window toCopyFromParent restores the default border pixmap.Changing the win-gravity does not affect the currentposition of the window.Changing the backing-store of an obscured window toWhenMapped or Always or changing the backing-planes,backing-pixel, or save-under of a mapped window may have noimmediate effect.Multiple clients can select input on the same window; theirevent-masks are disjoint. When an event is generated, itwill be reported to all interested clients. However, onlyone client at a time can select for SubstructureRedirect,only one client at a time can select for ResizeRedirect, andonly one client at a time can select for ButtonPress. Anattempt to violate these restrictions results in an Accesserror.There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, notone per client.Changing the colormap of a window (by defining a new map,not by changing the contents of the existing map) generatesa ColormapNotify event. Changing the colormap of a visiblewindow might have no immediate effect on the screen (seeInstallColormap request).Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores thedefault cursor.The order in which attributes are verified and altered isserver-dependent.

The window is then removed from itscurrent position in the hierarchy and is inserted as a childof the specified parent. The x and y coordinates arerelative to the parent&rsquo;s origin and specify the new positionof the upper-left outer corner of the window. The window isplaced on top in the stacking order with respect tosiblings. A ReparentNotify event is then generated. Theoverride-redirect attribute of the window is passed on inthis event; a value of True indicates that a window managershould not tamper with this window. Finally, if the windowwas originally mapped, a MapWindow request is performedautomatically.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed. The server might not generate exposure eventsfor regions from the initial unmap that are immediatelyobscured by the final map.A Match error is generated if:&bull; The new parent is not on the same screen as the oldparent.&bull; The new parent is the window itself or an inferior ofthe window.&bull; The new parent is InputOnly, and the window is not.&bull; The window has a ParentRelative background, and the newparent is not the same depth as the window.__&#9474; MapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already mapped, this request has no effect.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, then a MapRequest event is generated, but thewindow remains unmapped. Otherwise, the window is mapped,and a MapNotify event is generated.If the window is now viewable and its contents have beendiscarded, the window is tiled with its background (if nobackground is defined, the existing screen contents are notaltered), and zero or more exposure events are generated.If a backing-store has been maintained while the window wasunmapped, no exposure events are generated.

Thevalue-mask and value-list specify which values are to begiven. The possible values are:The x and y coordinates are relative to the parent&rsquo;s originand specify the position of the upper-left outer corner ofthe window. The width and height specify the inside size,not including the border, and must be nonzero (or a Valueerror results). Those values not specified are taken fromthe existing geometry of the window. Note that changingjust the border-width leaves the outer-left corner of thewindow in a fixed position but moves the absolute positionof the window&rsquo;s origin. It is a Match error to attempt tomake the border-width of an InputOnly window nonzero.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, a ConfigureRequest event is generated, and nofurther processing is performed. Otherwise, the followingis performed:If some other client has selected ResizeRedirect on thewindow and the inside width or height of the window is beingchanged, a ResizeRequest event is generated, and the currentinside width and height are used instead. Note that theoverride-redirect attribute of the window has no effect onResizeRedirect and that SubstructureRedirect on the parenthas precedence over ResizeRedirect on the window.The geometry of the window is changed as specified, thewindow is restacked among siblings, and a ConfigureNotifyevent is generated if the state of the window actuallychanges. If the inside width or height of the window hasactually changed, then children of the window are affected,according to their win-gravity. Exposure processing isperformed on formerly obscured windows (including the windowitself and its inferiors if regions of them were obscuredbut now are not). Exposure processing is also performed onany new regions of the window (as a result of increasing thewidth or height) and on any regions where window contentsare lost.If the inside width or height of a window is not changed butthe window is moved or its border is changed, then thecontents of the window are not lost but move with thewindow. Changing the inside width or height of the windowcauses its contents to be moved or lost, depending on thebit-gravity of the window. It also causes children to bereconfigured, depending on their win-gravity. For a changeof width and height of W and H, we define the [x, y] pairsas:When a window with one of these bit-gravities is resized,the corresponding pair defines the change in position ofeach pixel in the window. When a window with one of thesewin-gravities has its parent window resized, thecorresponding pair defines the change in position of thewindow within the parent. This repositioning generates aGravityNotify event. GravityNotify events are generatedafter the ConfigureNotify event is generated.A gravity of Static indicates that the contents or originshould not move relative to the origin of the root window.If the change in size of the window is coupled with a changein position of [X, Y], then for bit-gravity the change inposition of each pixel is [&minus;X, &minus;Y] and for win-gravity thechange in position of a child when its parent is so resizedis [&minus;X, &minus;Y]. Note that Static gravity still only takeseffect when the width or height of the window is changed,not when the window is simply moved.A bit-gravity of Forget indicates that the window contentsare always discarded after a size change, even ifbacking-store or save-under has been requested. The windowis tiled with its background (except, if no background isdefined, the existing screen contents are not altered) andzero or more exposure events are generated.The contents and borders of inferiors are not affected bytheir parent&rsquo;s bit-gravity. A server is permitted to ignorethe specified bit-gravity and use Forget instead.A win-gravity of Unmap is like NorthWest, but the child isalso unmapped when the parent is resized, and an UnmapNotifyevent is generated. UnmapNotify events are generated afterthe ConfigureNotify event is generated.If a sibling and a stack-mode are specified, the window isrestacked as follows:If a stack-mode is specified but no sibling is specified,the window is restacked as follows:It is a Match error if a sibling is specified without astack-mode or if the window is not actually a sibling.Note that the computations for BottomIf, TopIf, and Oppositeare performed with respect to the window&rsquo;s final geometry(as controlled by the other arguments to the request), notto its initial geometry.Attempts to configure a root window have no effect.__&#9474; CirculateWindowwindow: WINDOWdirection: {RaiseLowest, LowerHighest}Errors: Value, Window&#9474;__ If some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe window, then a CirculateRequest event is generated, andno further processing is performed. Otherwise, thefollowing is performed, and then a CirculateNotify event isgenerated if the window is actually restacked.For RaiseLowest, CirculateWindow raises the lowest mappedchild (if any) that is occluded by another child to the topof the stack. For LowerHighest, CirculateWindow lowers thehighest mapped child (if any) that occludes another child tothe bottom of the stack. Exposure processing is performedon formerly obscured windows.__&#9474; GetGeometrydrawable: DRAWABLE&rarr;root: WINDOWdepth: CARD8x, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16Errors: Drawable&#9474;__ This request returns the root and current geometry of thedrawable. The depth is the number of bits per pixel for theobject. The x, y, and border-width will always be zero forpixmaps. For a window, the x and y coordinates specify theupper-left outer corner of the window relative to itsparent&rsquo;s origin, and the width and height specify the insidesize, not including the border.It is legal to pass an InputOnly window as a drawable tothis request.__&#9474; QueryTreewindow: WINDOW&rarr;root: WINDOWparent: WINDOW or Nonechildren: LISTofWINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request returns the root, the parent, and the childrenof the window.

However, if the reported event causes the grab tobe released, then the devices do not freeze (but if theother device is still grabbed, then a subsequent event forit will still cause both devices to freeze). SyncBoth hasno effect unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by theclient. If the pointer or keyboard is frozen twice by theclient on behalf of two separate grabs, SyncBoth thaws forboth (but a subsequent freeze for SyncBoth will only freezeeach device once).For AsyncBoth, if the pointer and the keyboard are frozen bythe client, event processing for both devices continuesnormally.

The context components are:&nbsp;&nbsp;In graphics operations, given a source and destinationpixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bitsof the pixels; that is, a Boolean operation is performed ineach bit plane. The plane-mask restricts the operation to asubset of planes, so the result is:((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))Range checking is not performed on the values forforeground, background, or plane-mask. They are simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits.The meanings of the functions are:The line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater thanor equal to one, a wide line, or the special value zero, athin line.Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by thegraphics request. Unless otherwise specified by the join orcap style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints[x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle with verticesat the following real coordinates:[x1&minus;(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1&minus;(w*cs/2)],[x2&minus;(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2&minus;(w*cs/2)]The sn is the sine of the angle of the line and cs is thecosine of the angle of the line. A pixel is part of theline (and hence drawn) if the center of the pixel is fullyinside the bounding box, which is viewed as havinginfinitely thin edges. If the center of the pixel isexactly on the bounding box, it is part of the line if andonly if the interior is immediately to its right (xincreasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontaledge are a special case and are part of the line if and onlyif the interior or the boundary is immediately below (yincreasing direction) and if the interior or the boundary isimmediately to the right (x increasing direction). Notethat this description is a mathematical model describing thepixels that are drawn for a wide line and does not implythat trigonometry is required to implement such a model.Real or fixed point arithmetic is recommended for computingthe corners of the line endpoints for lines greater than onepixel in width.Thin lines (zero line-width) are nominally one pixel widelines drawn using an unspecified, device-dependentalgorithm. There are only two constraints on thisalgorithm. First, if a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1]to [x2,y2] and another line is drawn unclipped from[x1+dx,y1+dy] to [x2+dx,y2+dy], then a point [x,y] istouched by drawing the first line if and only if the point[x+dx,y+dy] is touched by drawing the second line. Second,the effective set of points comprising a line cannot beaffected by clipping. Thus, a point is touched in a clippedline if and only if the point lies inside the clippingregion and the point would be touched by the line when drawnunclipped.Note that a wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] alwaysdraws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to[x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style.Implementors are encouraged to make this property true forthin lines, but it is not required. A line-width of zeromay differ from a line-width of one in which pixels aredrawn. In general, drawing a thin line will be faster thandrawing a wide line of width one, but thin lines may not mixwell aesthetically with wide lines because of the differentdrawing algorithms. If it is desirable to obtain preciseand uniform results across all displays, a client shouldalways use a line-width of one, rather than a line-width ofzero.The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the semanticsdepends on the line-width and the cap-style:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe join-style is applied at one or both endpoints, theeffect is as if the line was removed from the overall path.However, if the total path consists of (or is reduced to) asingle point joined with itself, the effect is the same aswhen the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensionalplane with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions.When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in agraphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instanceof the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within thedrawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. Thetile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative tothe origin of whatever destination drawable is specified ina graphics request.The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as thegcontext (or a Match error results). The stipple pixmapmust have depth one and must have the same root as thegcontext (or a Match error results). For fill-styleStippled (but not fill-style OpaqueStippled), the stipplepattern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an additionalclip mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask. Any size pixmapcan be used for tiling or stippling, although some sizes maybe faster to use than others.The fill-style defines the contents of the source for line,text, and fill requests. For all text and fill requests(for example, PolyText8, PolyText16, PolyFillRectangle,FillPoly, and PolyFillArc) as well as for line requests withline-style Solid, (for example, PolyLine, PolySegment,PolyRectangle, PolyArc) and for the even dashes for linerequests with line-style OnOffDash or DoubleDash:For the odd dashes for line requests with line-styleDoubleDash:The dashes value allowed here is actually a simplified formof the more general patterns that can be set with SetDashes.Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to specifying thetwo element list [N, N] in SetDashes. The value must benonzero (or a Value error results). The meaning ofdash-offset and dashes are explained in the SetDashesrequest.The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable.Only pixels where the clip-mask has bits set to 1 are drawn.Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered by theclip-mask or where the clip-mask has bits set to 0. Theclip-mask affects all graphics requests, but it does notclip sources. The clip-mask origin is interpreted relativeto the origin of whatever destination drawable is specifiedin a graphics request. If a pixmap is specified as theclip-mask, it must have depth 1 and have the same root asthe gcontext (or a Match error results). If clip-mask isNone, then pixels are always drawn, regardless of the cliporigin. The clip-mask can also be set with theSetClipRectangles request.For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows areadditionally clipped by all viewable InputOutput children.For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination windowis clipped by inferiors. This will result in includingsubwindow contents in the source and drawing throughsubwindow boundaries of the destination. The use ofIncludeInferiors with a source or destination window of onedepth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is notillegal, but the semantics is undefined by the coreprotocol.The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (that is, aredrawn) for paths given in FillPoly requests. EvenOdd meansa point is inside if an infinite ray with the point asorigin crosses the path an odd number of times. ForWinding, a point is inside if an infinite ray with the pointas origin crosses an unequal number of clockwise andcounterclockwise directed path segments. A clockwisedirected path segment is one that crosses the ray from leftto right as observed from the point. A counter-clockwisesegment is one that crosses the ray from right to left asobserved from the point. The case where a directed linesegment is coincident with the ray is uninteresting becauseone can simply choose a different ray that is not coincidentwith a segment.For both fill rules, a point is infinitely small and thepath is an infinitely thin line. A pixel is inside if thecenter point of the pixel is inside and the center point isnot on the boundary. If the center point is on theboundary, the pixel is inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately to its right (x increasingdirection). Pixels with centers along a horizontal edge area special case and are inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately below (y increasing direction).The arc-mode controls filling in the PolyFillArc request.The graphics-exposures flag controls GraphicsExposure eventgeneration for CopyArea and CopyPlane requests (and anysimilar requests defined by extensions).The default component values are:Storing a pixmap in a gcontext might or might not result ina copy being made. If the pixmap is later used as thedestination for a graphics request, the change might ormight not be reflected in the gcontext. If the pixmap isused simultaneously in a graphics request as both adestination and as a tile or stipple, the results are notdefined.It is quite likely that some amount of gcontext informationwill be cached in display hardware and that such hardwarecan only cache a small number of gcontexts. Given thenumber and complexity of components, clients should viewswitching between gcontexts with nearly identical state assignificantly more expensive than making minor changes to asingle gcontext.__&#9474; ChangeGCgc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Font, GContext, Match, Pixmap, Value&#9474;__ This request changes components in gc. The value-mask andvalue-list specify which components are to be changed. Thevalues and restrictions are the same as for CreateGC.Changing the clip-mask also overrides any previousSetClipRectangles request on the context. Changingdash-offset or dashes overrides any previous SetDashesrequest on the context.The order in which components are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of thecomponents may have been altered.__&#9474; CopyGCsrc-gc, dst-gc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKErrors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request copies components from src-gc to dst-gc.

Dashes cannot be empty (or a Value errorresults). Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent tospecifying the same list concatenated with itself to producean even-length list. The initial and alternating elementsof dashes are the even dashes; the others are the odddashes. Each element specifies a dash length in pixels.All of the elements must be nonzero (or a Value errorresults). The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern,specifying how many pixels into dashes the pattern shouldactually begin in any single graphics request. Dashing iscontinuous through path elements combined with a join-stylebut is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence ofjoined lines.The unit of measure for dashes is the same as in theordinary coordinate system. Ideally, a dash length ismeasured along the slope of the line, but implementationsare only required to match this ideal for horizontal andvertical lines. Failing the ideal semantics, it issuggested that the length be measured along the major axisof the line. The major axis is defined as the x axis forlines drawn at an angle of between &minus;45 and +45 degrees orbetween 135 and 225 degrees from the x axis. For all otherlines, the major axis is the y axis.For any graphics primitive, the computation of the endpointof an individual dash only depends on the geometry of theprimitive, the start position of the dash, the direction ofthe dash, and the dash length.For any graphics primitive, the total set of pixels used torender the primitive (both even and odd numbered dashelements) with DoubleDash line-style is the same as the setof pixels used to render the primitive with Solidline-style.For any graphics primitive, if the primitive is drawn withOnOffDash or DoubleDash line-style unclipped at position[x,y] and again at position [x+dx,y+dy], then a point[x1,y1] is included in a dash in the first instance if andonly if the point [x1+dx,y1+dy] is included in the dash inthe second instance. In addition, the effective set ofpoints comprising a dash cannot be affected by clipping.

The start of the arc is specified byangle1 relative to the three-o&rsquo;clock position from thecenter of the rectangle, and the path and extent of the arcis specified by angle2 relative to the start of the arc. Ifthe magnitude of angle2 is greater than 360 degrees, it istruncated to 360 degrees. The x and y coordinates of therectangle are relative to the origin of the drawable. Foran arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the origin of the majorand minor axes is at [x+(w/2),y+(h/2)], and the infinitelythin path describing the entire circle/ellipse intersectsthe horizontal axis at [x,y+(h/2)] and [x+w,y+(h/2)] andintersects the vertical axis at [x+(w/2),y] and[x+(w/2),y+h]. These coordinates are not necessarilyintegral; that is, they are not truncated to discretecoordinates.For a wide line with line-width lw, the ideal boundingoutlines for filling are given by the two infinitely thinpaths consisting of all points whose perpendicular distancefrom a tangent to the path of the circle/ellipse is equal tolw/2 (which may be a fractional value). When the width andheight of the arc are not equal and both are nonzero, thenthe actual bounding outlines are implementation dependent.However, the computation of the shape and position of thebounding outlines (relative to the center of the arc) onlydepends on the width and height of the arc and theline-width.The cap-style is applied the same as for a linecorresponding to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at theendpoint. When the angle of an arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, and the width and height of the arcare both are nonzero, then the shape and position of the capat that face is implementation dependent. However, for aButt cap, the face is defined by a straight line, and thecomputation of the position (relative to the center of thearc) and the slope of the line only depends on the width andheight of the arc and the angle of the arc face. For othercap styles, the computation of the position (relative to thecenter of the arc) and the shape of the cap only depends onthe width and height of the arc, the line-width, the angleof the arc face, and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the arc from the endpoint.The join-style is applied the same as for two linescorresponding to the tangents of the circles/ellipses at thejoin point. When the width and height of both arcs arenonzero, and the angle of either arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, then the shape of the join isimplementation dependent. However, the computation of theshape only depends on the width and height of each arc, theline-width, the angles of the two arc faces, the direction(clockwise or counter clockwise) of the arcs from the joinpoint, and the relative orientation of the two arc centerpoints.For an arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the angles must bespecified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of theellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems areidentical). The relationship between these angles andangles expressed in the normal coordinate system of thescreen (as measured with a protractor) is as follows:skewed-angle = atan(tan(normal-angle) * w/h) + adjustThe skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians(rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range [0,2*PI).The atan returns a value in the range [&minus;PI/2,PI/2].

A server is notrequired to support these families and may support familiesnot listed here. Use of an unsupported family, an improperaddress format, or an improper address length within asupported family results in a Value error.Note that use of a host address in the ChangeHosts requestis deprecated. It is only useful when a host has a unique,constant address, a requirement that is increasingly unmetas sites adopt dynamically assigned addresses, networkaddress translation gateways, IPv6 link local addresses, andvarious other technologies. It also assumes all users of ahost share equivalent access rights, and as such has neverbeen suitable for many multi-user machine environments.Instead, more secure forms of authentication, such as thosebased on shared secrets or public key encryption, arerecommended.For the Internet family, the address must be four byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The Internet family supports IP version 4 addresses only.For the InternetV6 family, the address must be sixteen byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The InternetV6 family supports IP version 6 addresses only.For the DECnet family, the server performs no automaticswapping on the address bytes.

Connection CloseAt connection close, all event selections made by the clientare discarded. If the client has the pointer activelygrabbed, an UngrabPointer is performed. If the client hasthe keyboard actively grabbed, an UngrabKeyboard isperformed. All passive grabs by the client are released.If the client has the server grabbed, an UngrabServer isperformed. All selections (see SetSelectionOwner request)owned by the client are disowned. If close-down mode (seeSetCloseDownMode request) is RetainPermanent orRetainTemporary, then all resources (including colormapentries) allocated by the client are marked as permanent ortemporary, respectively (but this does not prevent otherclients from explicitly destroying them). If the mode isDestroy, all of the client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed.When a client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed, for each window inthe client&rsquo;s save-set, if the window is an inferior of awindow created by the client, the save-set window isreparented to the closest ancestor such that the save-setwindow is not an inferior of a window created by the client.If the save-set window is unmapped, a MapWindow request isperformed on it (even if it was not an inferior of a windowcreated by the client). The reparenting leaves unchangedthe absolute coordinates (with respect to the root window)of the upper-left outer corner of the save-set window.After save-set processing, all windows created by the clientare destroyed. For each nonwindow resource created by theclient, the appropriate Free request is performed. Allcolors and colormap entries allocated by the client arefreed.A server goes through a cycle of having no connections andhaving some connections. At every transition to the stateof having no connections as a result of a connection closingwith a Destroy close-down mode, the server resets its stateas if it had just been started. This starts by destroyingall lingering resources from clients that have terminated inRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode. It additionallyincludes deleting all but the predefined atom identifiers,deleting all properties on all root windows, resetting alldevice maps and attributes (key click, bell volume,acceleration), resetting the access control list, restoringthe standard root tiles and cursors, restoring the defaultfont path, and restoring the input focus to statePointerRoot.Note that closing a connection with a close-down mode ofRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary will not cause the serverto reset.11. EventsWhen a button press is processed with the pointer in somewindow W and no active pointer grab is in progress, theancestors of W are searched from the root down, looking fora passive grab to activate. If no matching passive grab onthe button exists, then an active grab is startedautomatically for the client receiving the event, and thelast-pointer-grab time is set to the current server time.The effect is essentially equivalent to a GrabButton witharguments:The grab is terminated automatically when the logical stateof the pointer has all buttons released. UngrabPointer andChangeActivePointerGrab can both be used to modify theactive grab.__&#9474; KeyPressKeyReleaseButtonPressButtonReleaseMotionNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16detail: &lt;see below&gt;state: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ These events are generated either when a key or buttonlogically changes state or when the pointer logically moves.The generation of these logical changes may lag the physicalchanges if device event processing is frozen. Note thatKeyPress and KeyRelease are generated for all keys, eventhose mapped to modifier bits. The source of the event isthe window the pointer is in. The window the event isreported with respect to is called the event window. Theevent window is found by starting with the source window andlooking up the hierarchy for the first window on which anyclient has selected interest in the event (provided nointervening window prohibits event generation by includingthe event type in its do-not-propagate-mask). The actualwindow used for reporting can be modified by active grabsand, in the case of keyboard events, can be modified by thefocus window.The root is the root window of the source window, and root-xand root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;sorigin at the time of the event. Event is the event window.If the event window is on the same screen as root, thenevent-x and event-y are the pointer coordinates relative tothe event window&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-yare zero. If the source window is an inferior of the eventwindow, then child is set to the child of the event windowthat is an ancestor of (or is) the source window.Otherwise, it is set to None. The state component gives thelogical state of the buttons and modifier keys just beforethe event. The detail component type varies with the eventtype:MotionNotify events are only generated when the motionbegins and ends in the window. The granularity of motionevents is not guaranteed, but a client selecting for motionevents is guaranteed to get at least one event when thepointer moves and comes to rest. Selecting PointerMotionreceives events independent of the state of the pointerbuttons. By selecting some subset of Button[1-5]Motioninstead, MotionNotify events will only be received when oneor more of the specified buttons are pressed. By selectingButtonMotion, MotionNotify events will be received only whenat least one button is pressed. The events are always oftype MotionNotify, independent of the selection. IfPointerMotionHint is selected, the server is free to sendonly one MotionNotify event (with detail Hint) to the clientfor the event window until either the key or button statechanges, the pointer leaves the event window, or the clientissues a QueryPointer or GetMotionEvents request.__&#9474; EnterNotifyLeaveNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16mode: {Normal, Grab, Ungrab}detail: {Ancestor, Virtual, Inferior, Nonlinear,NonlinearVirtual}focus: BOOLstate: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ If pointer motion or window hierarchy change causes thepointer to be in a different window than before, EnterNotifyand LeaveNotify events are generated instead of aMotionNotify event.

The rootis the root window for this position, and root-x and root-yare the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;s origin at thetime of the event. Event is the event window. If the eventwindow is on the same screen as root, then event-x andevent-y are the pointer coordinates relative to the eventwindow&rsquo;s origin.

The format specifies whether the datashould be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bitquantities, so that the server can correctly byte-swap, asnecessary. The data always consists of either 20 8-bitvalues or 10 16-bit values or 5 32-bit values, althoughparticular message types might not make use of all of thesevalues.12. Flow Control and ConcurrencyWhenever the server is writing to a given connection, it ispermissible for the server to stop reading from thatconnection (but if the writing would block, it must continueto service other connections). The server is not requiredto buffer more than a single request per connection at onetime. For a given connection to the server, a client canblock while reading from the connection but should undertaketo read (events and errors) when writing would block.Failure on the part of a client to obey this rule couldresult in a deadlocked connection, although deadlock isprobably unlikely unless either the transport layer has verylittle buffering or the client attempts to send largenumbers of requests without ever reading replies or checkingfor errors and events.Whether or not a server is implemented with internalconcurrency, the overall effect must be as if individualrequests are executed to completion in some serial order,and requests from a given connection must be executed indelivery order (that is, the total execution order is ashuffle of the individual streams). The execution of arequest includes validating all arguments, collecting alldata for any reply, and generating and queueing all requiredevents. However, it does not include the actualtransmission of the reply and the events. In addition, theeffect of any other cause that can generate multiple events(for example, activation of a grab or pointer motion) musteffectively generate and queue all required eventsindivisibly with respect to all other causes and requests.For a request from a given client, any events destined forthat client that are caused by executing the request must besent to the client before any reply or error is sent.1</a><br>

<a name="1. Protocol FormatsRequest Format"></a>
<h2>1. Protocol FormatsRequest Format</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Every request
contains an 8-bit major opcode and a 16-bit length field
expressed in units of four bytes. Every request consists of
four bytes of a header (containing the major opcode, the
length field, and a data byte) followed by zero or more
additional bytes of data. The length field defines the total
length of the request, including the header. The length
field in a request must equal the minimum length required to
contain the request. If the specified length is smaller or
larger than the required length, an error is generated.
Unused bytes in a request are not required to be zero. Major
opcodes 128 through 255 are reserved for extensions.
Extensions are intended to contain multiple requests, so
extension requests typically have an additional minor opcode
encoded in the second data byte in the request header.
However, the placement and interpretation of this minor
opcode and of all other fields in extension requests are not
defined by the core protocol. Every request on a given
connection is implicitly assigned a sequence number,
starting with one, that is used in replies, errors, and
events.</p>

<a name="Reply Format"></a>
<h2>Reply Format</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Every reply
contains a 32-bit length field expressed in units of four
bytes. Every reply consists of 32 bytes followed by zero or
more additional bytes of data, as specified in the length
field. Unused bytes within a reply are not guaranteed to be
zero. Every reply also contains the least significant 16
bits of the sequence number of the corresponding
request.</p>

<a name="Error Format"></a>
<h2>Error Format</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Error reports are
32 bytes long. Every error includes an 8-bit error code.
Error codes 128 through 255 are reserved for extensions.
Every error also includes the major and minor opcodes of the
failed request and the least significant 16 bits of the
sequence number of the request. For the following errors
(see section 4), the failing resource ID is also returned:
<i>Colormap</i>, <i>Cursor</i>, <i>Drawable</i>,

<h2>Event Format</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Events are 32 bytes
long. Unused bytes within an event are not guaranteed to be
zero. Every event contains an 8-bit type code. The most
significant bit in this code is set if the event was
generated from a <i>SendEvent</i> request. Event codes 64
through 127 are reserved for extensions, although the core
protocol does not define a mechanism for selecting interest
in such events. Every core event (with the exception of
<i>KeymapNotify</i>) also contains the least significant 16
bits of the sequence number of the last request issued by
the client that was (or is currently being) processed by the
server.</p>

Connection SetupFor remote clients, the X protocol can be built on top ofany reliable byte stream.Connection Initiation</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The client must
send an initial byte of data to identify the byte order to
be employed. The value of the byte must be octal 102 or 154.
The value 102 (ASCII uppercase B) means values are
transmitted most significant byte first, and value 154
(ASCII lowercase l) means values are transmitted least
significant byte first. Except where explicitly noted in the
protocol, all 16-bit and 32-bit quantities sent by the
client must be transmitted with this byte order, and all
16-bit and 32-bit quantities returned by the server will be
transmitted with this byte order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Following the
byte-order byte, the client sends the following information
at connection setup:</p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">protocol-major-version:

protocol-minor-version: CARD16 <br>
authorization-protocol-name: STRING8 <br>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The version numbers
indicate what version of the protocol the client expects the
server to implement.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The authorization
name indicates what authorization (and authentication)
protocol the client expects the server to use, and the data
is specific to that protocol. Specification of valid
authorization mechanisms is not part of the core X protocol.
A server that does not implement the protocol the client
expects or that only implements the host-based mechanism may
simply ignore this information. If both name and data
strings are empty, this is to be interpreted as
&lsquo;&lsquo;no explicit authorization.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<a name="Server Information"></a>
<h2>Server Information</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The information
that is global to the server is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The protocol
version numbers are an escape hatch in case future revisions
of the protocol are necessary. In general, the major version
would increment for incompatible changes, and the minor
version would increment for small upward compatible changes.
Barring changes, the major version will be 11, and the minor
version will be 0. The protocol version numbers returned
indicate the protocol the server actually supports. This
might not equal the version sent by the client. The server
can (but need not) refuse connections from clients that
offer a different version than the server supports. A server
can (but need not) support more than one version
simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The vendor string
gives some identification of the owner of the server
implementation. The vendor controls the semantics of the
release number.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The
resource-id-mask contains a single contiguous set of bits
(at least 18). The client allocates resource IDs for types
WINDOW, PIXMAP, CURSOR, FONT, GCONTEXT, and COLORMAP by
choosing a value with only some subset of these bits set and
ORing it with resource-id-base. Only values constructed in
this way can be used to name newly created resources over
this connection. Resource IDs never have the top three bits
set. The client is not restricted to linear or contiguous
allocation of resource IDs. Once an ID has been freed, it
can be reused. An ID must be unique with respect to the IDs
of all other resources, not just other resources of the same
type. However, note that the value spaces of resource
identifiers, atoms, visualids, and keysyms are distinguished
by context, and as such, are not required to be disjoint;
for example, a given numeric value might be both a valid
window ID, a valid atom, and a valid keysym.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Although the server
is in general responsible for byte-swapping data to match
the client, images are always transmitted and received in
formats (including byte order) specified by the server. The
byte order for images is given by image-byte-order and
applies to each scanline unit in XY format (bitmap format)
and to each pixel value in Z format.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">A bitmap is
represented in scanline order. Each scanline is padded to a
multiple of bits as given by bitmap-scanline-pad. The pad
bits are of arbitrary value. The scanline is quantized in
multiples of bits as given by bitmap-scanline-unit. The
bitmap-scanline-unit is always less than or equal to the
bitmap-scanline-pad. Within each unit, the leftmost bit in
the bitmap is either the least significant or most
significant bit in the unit, as given by bitmap-bit-order.
If a pixmap is represented in XY format, each plane is
represented as a bitmap, and the planes appear from most
significant to least significant in bit order with no
padding between planes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Pixmap-formats
contains one entry for each depth value. The entry describes
the Z format used to represent images of that depth. An
entry for a depth is included if any screen supports that
depth, and all screens supporting that depth must support
only that Z format for that depth. In Z format, the pixels
are in scanline order, left to right within a scanline. The
number of bits used to hold each pixel is given by
bits-per-pixel. Bits-per-pixel may be larger than strictly
required by the depth, in which case the least significant
bits are used to hold the pixmap data, and the values of the
unused high-order bits are undefined. When the
bits-per-pixel is 4, the order of nibbles in the byte is the
same as the image byte-order. When the bits-per-pixel is 1,
the format is identical for bitmap format. Each scanline is
padded to a multiple of bits as given by scanline-pad. When
bits-per-pixel is 1, this will be identical to
bitmap-scanline-pad.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">How a pointing
device roams the screens is up to the server implementation
and is transparent to the protocol. No geometry is defined
among screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The server may
retain the recent history of pointer motion and do so to a
finer granularity than is reported by <i>MotionNotify</i>
events. The <i>GetMotionEvents</i> request makes such
history available. The motion-buffer-size gives the
approximate maximum number of elements in the history
buffer.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Maximum-request-length
specifies the maximum length of a request accepted by the
server, in 4-byte units. That is, length is the maximum
value that can appear in the length field of a request.
Requests larger than this maximum generate a <i>Length</i>
error, and the server will read and simply discard the
entire request. Maximum-request-length will always be at
least 4096 (that is, requests of length up to and including
16384 bytes will be accepted by all servers).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Min-keycode and
max-keycode specify the smallest and largest keycode values
transmitted by the server. Min-keycode is never less than 8,
and max-keycode is never greater than 255. Not all keycodes
in this range are required to have corresponding keys.</p>

<a name="Screen Information"></a>
<h2>Screen Information</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The information
that applies per screen is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The allowed-depths
specifies what pixmap and window depths are supported.
Pixmaps are supported for each depth listed, and windows of
that depth are supported if at least one visual type is
listed for the depth. A pixmap depth of one is always
supported and listed, but windows of depth one might not be
supported. A depth of zero is never listed, but zero-depth
<i>InputOnly</i> windows are always supported.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Root-depth and
root-visual specify the depth and visual type of the root
window. Width-in-pixels and height-in-pixels specify the
size of the root window (which cannot be changed). The class
of the root window is always <i>InputOutput</i>.
Width-in-millimeters and height-in-millimeters can be used
to determine the physical size and the aspect ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The
default-colormap is the one initially associated with the
root window. Clients with minimal color requirements
creating windows of the same depth as the root may want to
allocate from this map by default.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Black-pixel and
white-pixel can be used in implementing a monochrome
application. These pixel values are for permanently
allocated entries in the default-colormap. The actual RGB
values may be settable on some screens and, in any case, may
not actually be black and white. The names are intended to
convey the expected relative intensity of the colors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The border of the
root window is initially a pixmap filled with the
black-pixel. The initial background of the root window is a
pixmap filled with some unspecified two-color pattern using
black-pixel and white-pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Min-installed-maps
specifies the number of maps that can be guaranteed to be
installed simultaneously (with <i>InstallColormap</i>),
regardless of the number of entries allocated in each map.
Max-installed-maps specifies the maximum number of maps that
might possibly be installed simultaneously, depending on
their allocations. Multiple static-visual colormaps with
identical contents but differing in resource ID should be
considered as a single map for the purposes of this number.
For the typical case of a single hardware colormap, both
values will be 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Backing-stores
indicates when the server supports backing stores for this
screen, although it may be storage limited in the number of
windows it can support at once. If save-unders is
<i>True</i>, the server can support the save-under mode in
<i>CreateWindow</i> and <i>ChangeWindowAttributes</i>,

<h2>Visual Information</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The information
that applies per visual-type is:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">A given visual type
might be listed for more than one depth or for more than one
screen.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">For
<i>PseudoColor</i>, a pixel value indexes a colormap to
produce independent RGB values; the RGB values can be
changed dynamically. <i>GrayScale</i> is treated in the same
way as <i>PseudoColor</i> except which primary drives the
screen is undefined; thus, the client should always store
the same value for red, green, and blue in colormaps. For
<i>DirectColor</i>, a pixel value is decomposed into
separate RGB subfields, and each subfield separately indexes
the colormap for the corresponding value. The RGB values can
be changed dynamically. <i>TrueColor</i> is treated in the
same way as <i>DirectColor</i> except the colormap has
predefined read-only RGB values. These values are
server-dependent but provide linear or near-linear
increasing ramps in each primary. <i>StaticColor</i> is
treated in the same way as <i>PseudoColor</i> except the
colormap has predefined read-only RGB values, which are
server-dependent. <i>StaticGray</i> is treated in the same
way as <i>StaticColor</i> except the red, green, and blue
values are equal for any single pixel value, resulting in
shades of gray. <i>StaticGray</i> with a two-entry colormap
can be thought of as monochrome.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The red-mask,
green-mask, and blue-mask are only defined for
<i>DirectColor</i> and <i>TrueColor</i>. Each has one
contiguous set of bits set to 1 with no intersections.
Usually each mask has the same number of bits set to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The
bits-per-rgb-value specifies the log base 2 of the number of
distinct color intensity values (individually) of red,
green, and blue. This number need not bear any relation to
the number of colormap entries. Actual RGB values are always
passed in the protocol within a 16-bit spectrum, with 0
being minimum intensity and 65535 being the maximum
intensity. On hardware that provides a linear zero-based
intensity ramp, the following relationship exists:</p>

<p style="margin-left:33%; margin-top: 1em">hw-intensity =
protocol-intensity / (65536 / total-hw-intensities)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Colormap entries
are indexed from 0. The colormap-entries defines the number
of available colormap entries in a newly created colormap.
For <i>DirectColor</i> and <i>TrueColor</i>, this will
usually be 2 to the power of the maximum number of bits set
to 1 in red-mask, green-mask, and blue-mask.</p>

<a name="9. Requests__&#9474; CreateWindowwid, parent: WINDOWclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly, CopyFromParent}depth: CARD8visual: VISUALID or CopyFromParentx, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16value-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Colormap, Cursor, IDChoice, Match, Pixmap,Value, Window&#9474;__ This request creates an unmapped window and assigns theidentifier wid to it.A class of CopyFromParent means the class is taken from theparent. A depth of zero for class InputOutput orCopyFromParent means the depth is taken from the parent. Avisual of CopyFromParent means the visual type is taken fromthe parent. For class InputOutput, the visual type anddepth must be a combination supported for the screen (or aMatch error results). The depth need not be the same as theparent, but the parent must not be of class InputOnly (or aMatch error results). For class InputOnly, the depth mustbe zero (or a Match error results), and the visual must beone supported for the screen (or a Match error results).However, the parent can have any depth and class.The server essentially acts as if InputOnly windows do notexist for the purposes of graphics requests, exposureprocessing, and VisibilityNotify events. An InputOnlywindow cannot be used as a drawable (as a source ordestination for graphics requests). InputOnly andInputOutput windows act identically in otherrespects&minus;properties, grabs, input control, and so on.The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Yaxis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-leftcorner. Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, andcoincide with pixel centers. Each window and pixmap has itsown coordinate system. For a window, the origin is insidethe border at the inside, upper-left corner.The x and y coordinates for the window are relative to theparent&rsquo;s origin and specify the position of the upper-leftouter corner of the window (not the origin). The width andheight specify the inside size (not including the border)and must be nonzero (or a Value error results). Theborder-width for an InputOnly window must be zero (or aMatch error results).The window is placed on top in the stacking order withrespect to siblings.The value-mask and value-list specify attributes of thewindow that are to be explicitly initialized. The possiblevalues are:The default values when attributes are not explicitlyinitialized are:Only the following attributes are defined for InputOnlywindows:&bull; win-gravity&bull; event-mask&bull; do-not-propagate-mask&bull; override-redirect&bull; cursorIt is a Match error to specify any other attributes forInputOnly windows.If background-pixmap is given, it overrides the defaultbackground-pixmap. The background pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If background None is specified,the window has no defined background. If backgroundParentRelative is specified, the parent&rsquo;s background isused, but the window must have the same depth as the parent(or a Match error results). If the parent has backgroundNone, then the window will also have background None. Acopy of the parent&rsquo;s background is not made. The parent&rsquo;sbackground is reexamined each time the window background isrequired. If background-pixel is given, it overrides thedefault background-pixmap and any background-pixmap givenexplicitly, and a pixmap of undefined size filled withbackground-pixel is used for the background. Range checkingis not performed on the background-pixel value; it is simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits. For aParentRelative background, the background tile origin alwaysaligns with the parent&rsquo;s background tile origin. Otherwise,the background tile origin is always the window origin.When no valid contents are available for regions of a windowand the regions are either visible or the server ismaintaining backing store, the server automatically tilesthe regions with the window&rsquo;s background unless the windowhas a background of None. If the background is None, theprevious screen contents from other windows of the samedepth as the window are simply left in place if the contentscome from the parent of the window or an inferior of theparent; otherwise, the initial contents of the exposedregions are undefined. Exposure events are then generatedfor the regions, even if the background is None.The border tile origin is always the same as the backgroundtile origin. If border-pixmap is given, it overrides thedefault border-pixmap. The border pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If CopyFromParent is given, theparent&rsquo;s border pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to theparent&rsquo;s border attribute do not affect the child), but thewindow must have the same depth as the parent (or a Matcherror results). The pixmap might be copied by sharing thesame pixmap object between the child and parent or by makinga complete copy of the pixmap contents. If border-pixel isgiven, it overrides the default border-pixmap and anyborder-pixmap given explicitly, and a pixmap of undefinedsize filled with border-pixel is used for the border. Rangechecking is not performed on the border-pixel value; it issimply truncated to the appropriate number of bits.Output to a window is always clipped to the inside of thewindow, so that the border is never affected.The bit-gravity defines which region of the window should beretained if the window is resized, and win-gravity defineshow the window should be repositioned if the parent isresized (see ConfigureWindow request).A backing-store of WhenMapped advises the server thatmaintaining contents of obscured regions when the window ismapped would be beneficial. A backing-store of Alwaysadvises the server that maintaining contents even when thewindow is unmapped would be beneficial. In this case, theserver may generate an exposure event when the window iscreated. A value of NotUseful advises the server thatmaintaining contents is unnecessary, although a server maystill choose to maintain contents while the window ismapped. Note that if the server maintains contents, thenthe server should maintain complete contents not just theregion within the parent boundaries, even if the window islarger than its parent. While the server maintainscontents, exposure events will not normally be generated,but the server may stop maintaining contents at any time.If save-under is True, the server is advised that when thiswindow is mapped, saving the contents of windows it obscureswould be beneficial.When the contents of obscured regions of a window are beingmaintained, regions obscured by noninferior windows areincluded in the destination (and source, when the window isthe source) of graphics requests, but regions obscured byinferior windows are not included.The backing-planes indicates (with bits set to 1) which bitplanes of the window hold dynamic data that must bepreserved in backing-stores and during save-unders. Thebacking-pixel specifies what value to use in planes notcovered by backing-planes. The server is free to save onlythe specified bit planes in the backing-store or save-underand regenerate the remaining planes with the specified pixelvalue. Any bits beyond the specified depth of the window inthese values are simply ignored.The event-mask defines which events the client is interestedin for this window (or for some event types, inferiors ofthe window). The do-not-propagate-mask defines which eventsshould not be propagated to ancestor windows when no clienthas the event type selected in this window.The override-redirect specifies whether map and configurerequests on this window should override aSubstructureRedirect on the parent, typically to inform awindow manager not to tamper with the window.The colormap specifies the colormap that best reflects thetrue colors of the window. Servers capable of supportingmultiple hardware colormaps may use this information, andwindow managers may use it for InstallColormap requests.The colormap must have the same visual type and root as thewindow (or a Match error results). If CopyFromParent isspecified, the parent&rsquo;s colormap is copied (subsequentchanges to the parent&rsquo;s colormap attribute do not affect thechild). However, the window must have the same visual typeas the parent (or a Match error results), and the parentmust not have a colormap of None (or a Match error results).For an explanation of None, see FreeColormap request. Thecolormap is copied by sharing the colormap object betweenthe child and the parent, not by making a complete copy ofthe colormap contents.If a cursor is specified, it will be used whenever thepointer is in the window. If None is specified, theparent&rsquo;s cursor will be used when the pointer is in thewindow, and any change in the parent&rsquo;s cursor will cause animmediate change in the displayed cursor.This request generates a CreateNotify event.The background and border pixmaps and the cursor may befreed immediately if no further explicit references to themare to be made.Subsequent drawing into the background or border pixmap hasan undefined effect on the window state. The server mightor might not make a copy of the pixmap.__&#9474; ChangeWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Access, Colormap, Cursor, Match, Pixmap, Value,Window&#9474;__ The value-mask and value-list specify which attributes areto be changed. The values and restrictions are the same asfor CreateWindow.Setting a new background, whether by background-pixmap orbackground-pixel, overrides any previous background.Setting a new border, whether by border-pixel orborder-pixmap, overrides any previous border.Changing the background does not cause the window contentsto be changed. Setting the border or changing thebackground such that the border tile origin changes causesthe border to be repainted. Changing the background of aroot window to None or ParentRelative restores the defaultbackground pixmap. Changing the border of a root window toCopyFromParent restores the default border pixmap.Changing the win-gravity does not affect the currentposition of the window.Changing the backing-store of an obscured window toWhenMapped or Always or changing the backing-planes,backing-pixel, or save-under of a mapped window may have noimmediate effect.Multiple clients can select input on the same window; theirevent-masks are disjoint. When an event is generated, itwill be reported to all interested clients. However, onlyone client at a time can select for SubstructureRedirect,only one client at a time can select for ResizeRedirect, andonly one client at a time can select for ButtonPress. Anattempt to violate these restrictions results in an Accesserror.There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, notone per client.Changing the colormap of a window (by defining a new map,not by changing the contents of the existing map) generatesa ColormapNotify event. Changing the colormap of a visiblewindow might have no immediate effect on the screen (seeInstallColormap request).Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores thedefault cursor.The order in which attributes are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of theattributes may have been altered.__&#9474; GetWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOW&rarr;visual: VISUALIDclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly}bit-gravity: BITGRAVITYwin-gravity: WINGRAVITYbacking-store: {NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always}backing-planes: CARD32backing-pixel: CARD32save-under: BOOLcolormap: COLORMAP or Nonemap-is-installed: BOOLmap-state: {Unmapped, Unviewable, Viewable}all-event-masks, your-event-mask: SETofEVENTdo-not-propagate-mask: SETofDEVICEEVENToverride-redirect: BOOLErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request returns the current attributes of the window.A window is Unviewable if it is mapped but some ancestor isunmapped.

The window and all inferiors arethen destroyed, and a DestroyNotify event is generated foreach window. The ordering of the DestroyNotify events issuch that for any given window, DestroyNotify is generatedon all inferiors of the window before being generated on thewindow itself. The ordering among siblings and acrosssubhierarchies is not otherwise constrained.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed.If the window is a root window, this request has no effect.__&#9474; DestroySubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs a DestroyWindow request on allchildren of the window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.__&#9474; ChangeSaveSetwindow: WINDOWmode: {Insert, Delete}Errors:Match, Value, Window&#9474;__ This request adds or removes the specified window from theclient&rsquo;s save-set. The window must have been created bysome other client (or a Match error results). For furtherinformation about the use of the save-set, see section 10.When windows are destroyed, the server automatically removesthem from the save-set.__&#9474; ReparentWindowwindow, parent: WINDOWx, y: INT16Errors: Match, Window&#9474;__ If the window is mapped, an UnmapWindow request is performedautomatically first. The window is then removed from itscurrent position in the hierarchy and is inserted as a childof the specified parent. The x and y coordinates arerelative to the parent&rsquo;s origin and specify the new positionof the upper-left outer corner of the window. The window isplaced on top in the stacking order with respect tosiblings. A ReparentNotify event is then generated. Theoverride-redirect attribute of the window is passed on inthis event; a value of True indicates that a window managershould not tamper with this window. Finally, if the windowwas originally mapped, a MapWindow request is performedautomatically.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed. The server might not generate exposure eventsfor regions from the initial unmap that are immediatelyobscured by the final map.A Match error is generated if:&bull; The new parent is not on the same screen as the oldparent.&bull; The new parent is the window itself or an inferior ofthe window.&bull; The new parent is InputOnly, and the window is not.&bull; The window has a ParentRelative background, and the newparent is not the same depth as the window.__&#9474; MapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already mapped, this request has no effect.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, then a MapRequest event is generated, but thewindow remains unmapped. Otherwise, the window is mapped,and a MapNotify event is generated.If the window is now viewable and its contents have beendiscarded, the window is tiled with its background (if nobackground is defined, the existing screen contents are notaltered), and zero or more exposure events are generated.If a backing-store has been maintained while the window wasunmapped, no exposure events are generated. If abacking-store will now be maintained, a full-window exposureis always generated. Otherwise, only visible regions may bereported. Similar tiling and exposure take place for anynewly viewable inferiors.__&#9474; MapSubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs a MapWindow request on all unmappedchildren of the window, in top-to-bottom stacking order.__&#9474; UnmapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already unmapped, this request has noeffect. Otherwise, the window is unmapped, and anUnmapNotify event is generated. Normal exposure processingon formerly obscured windows is performed.__&#9474; UnmapSubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs an UnmapWindow request on all mappedchildren of the window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.__&#9474; ConfigureWindowwindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Match, Value, Window&#9474;__ This request changes the configuration of the window. Thevalue-mask and value-list specify which values are to begiven. The possible values are:The x and y coordinates are relative to the parent&rsquo;s originand specify the position of the upper-left outer corner ofthe window. The width and height specify the inside size,not including the border, and must be nonzero (or a Valueerror results). Those values not specified are taken fromthe existing geometry of the window. Note that changingjust the border-width leaves the outer-left corner of thewindow in a fixed position but moves the absolute positionof the window&rsquo;s origin. It is a Match error to attempt tomake the border-width of an InputOnly window nonzero.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, a ConfigureRequest event is generated, and nofurther processing is performed. Otherwise, the followingis performed:If some other client has selected ResizeRedirect on thewindow and the inside width or height of the window is beingchanged, a ResizeRequest event is generated, and the currentinside width and height are used instead. Note that theoverride-redirect attribute of the window has no effect onResizeRedirect and that SubstructureRedirect on the parenthas precedence over ResizeRedirect on the window.The geometry of the window is changed as specified, thewindow is restacked among siblings, and a ConfigureNotifyevent is generated if the state of the window actuallychanges. If the inside width or height of the window hasactually changed, then children of the window are affected,according to their win-gravity. Exposure processing isperformed on formerly obscured windows (including the windowitself and its inferiors if regions of them were obscuredbut now are not). Exposure processing is also performed onany new regions of the window (as a result of increasing thewidth or height) and on any regions where window contentsare lost.If the inside width or height of a window is not changed butthe window is moved or its border is changed, then thecontents of the window are not lost but move with thewindow. Changing the inside width or height of the windowcauses its contents to be moved or lost, depending on thebit-gravity of the window. It also causes children to bereconfigured, depending on their win-gravity. For a changeof width and height of W and H, we define the [x, y] pairsas:When a window with one of these bit-gravities is resized,the corresponding pair defines the change in position ofeach pixel in the window. When a window with one of thesewin-gravities has its parent window resized, thecorresponding pair defines the change in position of thewindow within the parent. This repositioning generates aGravityNotify event. GravityNotify events are generatedafter the ConfigureNotify event is generated.A gravity of Static indicates that the contents or originshould not move relative to the origin of the root window.If the change in size of the window is coupled with a changein position of [X, Y], then for bit-gravity the change inposition of each pixel is [&minus;X, &minus;Y] and for win-gravity thechange in position of a child when its parent is so resizedis [&minus;X, &minus;Y]. Note that Static gravity still only takeseffect when the width or height of the window is changed,not when the window is simply moved.A bit-gravity of Forget indicates that the window contentsare always discarded after a size change, even ifbacking-store or save-under has been requested. The windowis tiled with its background (except, if no background isdefined, the existing screen contents are not altered) andzero or more exposure events are generated.The contents and borders of inferiors are not affected bytheir parent&rsquo;s bit-gravity. A server is permitted to ignorethe specified bit-gravity and use Forget instead.A win-gravity of Unmap is like NorthWest, but the child isalso unmapped when the parent is resized, and an UnmapNotifyevent is generated. UnmapNotify events are generated afterthe ConfigureNotify event is generated.If a sibling and a stack-mode are specified, the window isrestacked as follows:If a stack-mode is specified but no sibling is specified,the window is restacked as follows:It is a Match error if a sibling is specified without astack-mode or if the window is not actually a sibling.Note that the computations for BottomIf, TopIf, and Oppositeare performed with respect to the window&rsquo;s final geometry(as controlled by the other arguments to the request), notto its initial geometry.Attempts to configure a root window have no effect.__&#9474; CirculateWindowwindow: WINDOWdirection: {RaiseLowest, LowerHighest}Errors: Value, Window&#9474;__ If some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe window, then a CirculateRequest event is generated, andno further processing is performed. Otherwise, thefollowing is performed, and then a CirculateNotify event isgenerated if the window is actually restacked.For RaiseLowest, CirculateWindow raises the lowest mappedchild (if any) that is occluded by another child to the topof the stack. For LowerHighest, CirculateWindow lowers thehighest mapped child (if any) that occludes another child tothe bottom of the stack. Exposure processing is performedon formerly obscured windows.__&#9474; GetGeometrydrawable: DRAWABLE&rarr;root: WINDOWdepth: CARD8x, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16Errors: Drawable&#9474;__ This request returns the root and current geometry of thedrawable. The depth is the number of bits per pixel for theobject. The x, y, and border-width will always be zero forpixmaps. For a window, the x and y coordinates specify theupper-left outer corner of the window relative to itsparent&rsquo;s origin, and the width and height specify the insidesize, not including the border.It is legal to pass an InputOnly window as a drawable tothis request.__&#9474; QueryTreewindow: WINDOW&rarr;root: WINDOWparent: WINDOW or Nonechildren: LISTofWINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request returns the root, the parent, and the childrenof the window.

If the mode is Prepend or Append, then the typeand format must match the existing property value (or aMatch error results). If the property is undefined, it istreated as defined with the correct type and format withzero-length data. For Prepend, the data is tacked on to thebeginning of the existing data, and for Append, it is tackedon to the end of the existing data.This request generates a PropertyNotify event on the window.The lifetime of a property is not tied to the storingclient.

The context components are:&nbsp;&nbsp;In graphics operations, given a source and destinationpixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bitsof the pixels; that is, a Boolean operation is performed ineach bit plane. The plane-mask restricts the operation to asubset of planes, so the result is:((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))Range checking is not performed on the values forforeground, background, or plane-mask. They are simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits.The meanings of the functions are:The line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater thanor equal to one, a wide line, or the special value zero, athin line.Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by thegraphics request. Unless otherwise specified by the join orcap style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints[x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle with verticesat the following real coordinates:[x1&minus;(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1&minus;(w*cs/2)],[x2&minus;(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2&minus;(w*cs/2)]The sn is the sine of the angle of the line and cs is thecosine of the angle of the line. A pixel is part of theline (and hence drawn) if the center of the pixel is fullyinside the bounding box, which is viewed as havinginfinitely thin edges. If the center of the pixel isexactly on the bounding box, it is part of the line if andonly if the interior is immediately to its right (xincreasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontaledge are a special case and are part of the line if and onlyif the interior or the boundary is immediately below (yincreasing direction) and if the interior or the boundary isimmediately to the right (x increasing direction). Notethat this description is a mathematical model describing thepixels that are drawn for a wide line and does not implythat trigonometry is required to implement such a model.Real or fixed point arithmetic is recommended for computingthe corners of the line endpoints for lines greater than onepixel in width.Thin lines (zero line-width) are nominally one pixel widelines drawn using an unspecified, device-dependentalgorithm. There are only two constraints on thisalgorithm. First, if a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1]to [x2,y2] and another line is drawn unclipped from[x1+dx,y1+dy] to [x2+dx,y2+dy], then a point [x,y] istouched by drawing the first line if and only if the point[x+dx,y+dy] is touched by drawing the second line. Second,the effective set of points comprising a line cannot beaffected by clipping. Thus, a point is touched in a clippedline if and only if the point lies inside the clippingregion and the point would be touched by the line when drawnunclipped.Note that a wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] alwaysdraws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to[x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style.Implementors are encouraged to make this property true forthin lines, but it is not required. A line-width of zeromay differ from a line-width of one in which pixels aredrawn. In general, drawing a thin line will be faster thandrawing a wide line of width one, but thin lines may not mixwell aesthetically with wide lines because of the differentdrawing algorithms. If it is desirable to obtain preciseand uniform results across all displays, a client shouldalways use a line-width of one, rather than a line-width ofzero.The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the semanticsdepends on the line-width and the cap-style:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe join-style is applied at one or both endpoints, theeffect is as if the line was removed from the overall path.However, if the total path consists of (or is reduced to) asingle point joined with itself, the effect is the same aswhen the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensionalplane with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions.When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in agraphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instanceof the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within thedrawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. Thetile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative tothe origin of whatever destination drawable is specified ina graphics request.The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as thegcontext (or a Match error results). The stipple pixmapmust have depth one and must have the same root as thegcontext (or a Match error results). For fill-styleStippled (but not fill-style OpaqueStippled), the stipplepattern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an additionalclip mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask. Any size pixmapcan be used for tiling or stippling, although some sizes maybe faster to use than others.The fill-style defines the contents of the source for line,text, and fill requests. For all text and fill requests(for example, PolyText8, PolyText16, PolyFillRectangle,FillPoly, and PolyFillArc) as well as for line requests withline-style Solid, (for example, PolyLine, PolySegment,PolyRectangle, PolyArc) and for the even dashes for linerequests with line-style OnOffDash or DoubleDash:For the odd dashes for line requests with line-styleDoubleDash:The dashes value allowed here is actually a simplified formof the more general patterns that can be set with SetDashes.Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to specifying thetwo element list [N, N] in SetDashes. The value must benonzero (or a Value error results). The meaning ofdash-offset and dashes are explained in the SetDashesrequest.The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable.Only pixels where the clip-mask has bits set to 1 are drawn.Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered by theclip-mask or where the clip-mask has bits set to 0. Theclip-mask affects all graphics requests, but it does notclip sources. The clip-mask origin is interpreted relativeto the origin of whatever destination drawable is specifiedin a graphics request. If a pixmap is specified as theclip-mask, it must have depth 1 and have the same root asthe gcontext (or a Match error results). If clip-mask isNone, then pixels are always drawn, regardless of the cliporigin. The clip-mask can also be set with theSetClipRectangles request.For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows areadditionally clipped by all viewable InputOutput children.For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination windowis clipped by inferiors. This will result in includingsubwindow contents in the source and drawing throughsubwindow boundaries of the destination. The use ofIncludeInferiors with a source or destination window of onedepth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is notillegal, but the semantics is undefined by the coreprotocol.The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (that is, aredrawn) for paths given in FillPoly requests. EvenOdd meansa point is inside if an infinite ray with the point asorigin crosses the path an odd number of times. ForWinding, a point is inside if an infinite ray with the pointas origin crosses an unequal number of clockwise andcounterclockwise directed path segments. A clockwisedirected path segment is one that crosses the ray from leftto right as observed from the point. A counter-clockwisesegment is one that crosses the ray from right to left asobserved from the point. The case where a directed linesegment is coincident with the ray is uninteresting becauseone can simply choose a different ray that is not coincidentwith a segment.For both fill rules, a point is infinitely small and thepath is an infinitely thin line. A pixel is inside if thecenter point of the pixel is inside and the center point isnot on the boundary. If the center point is on theboundary, the pixel is inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately to its right (x increasingdirection). Pixels with centers along a horizontal edge area special case and are inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately below (y increasing direction).The arc-mode controls filling in the PolyFillArc request.The graphics-exposures flag controls GraphicsExposure eventgeneration for CopyArea and CopyPlane requests (and anysimilar requests defined by extensions).The default component values are:Storing a pixmap in a gcontext might or might not result ina copy being made. If the pixmap is later used as thedestination for a graphics request, the change might ormight not be reflected in the gcontext. If the pixmap isused simultaneously in a graphics request as both adestination and as a tile or stipple, the results are notdefined.It is quite likely that some amount of gcontext informationwill be cached in display hardware and that such hardwarecan only cache a small number of gcontexts. Given thenumber and complexity of components, clients should viewswitching between gcontexts with nearly identical state assignificantly more expensive than making minor changes to asingle gcontext.__&#9474; ChangeGCgc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Font, GContext, Match, Pixmap, Value&#9474;__ This request changes components in gc. The value-mask andvalue-list specify which components are to be changed. Thevalues and restrictions are the same as for CreateGC.Changing the clip-mask also overrides any previousSetClipRectangles request on the context. Changingdash-offset or dashes overrides any previous SetDashesrequest on the context.The order in which components are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of thecomponents may have been altered.__&#9474; CopyGCsrc-gc, dst-gc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKErrors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request copies components from src-gc to dst-gc.

Dashes cannot be empty (or a Value errorresults). Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent tospecifying the same list concatenated with itself to producean even-length list. The initial and alternating elementsof dashes are the even dashes; the others are the odddashes. Each element specifies a dash length in pixels.All of the elements must be nonzero (or a Value errorresults). The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern,specifying how many pixels into dashes the pattern shouldactually begin in any single graphics request. Dashing iscontinuous through path elements combined with a join-stylebut is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence ofjoined lines.The unit of measure for dashes is the same as in theordinary coordinate system. Ideally, a dash length ismeasured along the slope of the line, but implementationsare only required to match this ideal for horizontal andvertical lines. Failing the ideal semantics, it issuggested that the length be measured along the major axisof the line. The major axis is defined as the x axis forlines drawn at an angle of between &minus;45 and +45 degrees orbetween 135 and 225 degrees from the x axis. For all otherlines, the major axis is the y axis.For any graphics primitive, the computation of the endpointof an individual dash only depends on the geometry of theprimitive, the start position of the dash, the direction ofthe dash, and the dash length.For any graphics primitive, the total set of pixels used torender the primitive (both even and odd numbered dashelements) with DoubleDash line-style is the same as the setof pixels used to render the primitive with Solidline-style.For any graphics primitive, if the primitive is drawn withOnOffDash or DoubleDash line-style unclipped at position[x,y] and again at position [x+dx,y+dy], then a point[x1,y1] is included in a dash in the first instance if andonly if the point [x1+dx,y1+dy] is included in the dash inthe second instance. In addition, the effective set ofpoints comprising a dash cannot be affected by clipping. Apoint is included in a clipped dash if and only if the pointlies inside the clipping region and the point would beincluded in the dash when drawn unclipped.__&#9474; SetClipRectanglesgc: GCONTEXTclip-x-origin, clip-y-origin: INT16rectangles: LISTofRECTANGLEordering: {UnSorted, YSorted, YXSorted, YXBanded}Errors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request changes clip-mask in gc to the specified listof rectangles and sets the clip origin.

Each arc isspecified by a rectangle and two angles. The angles aresigned integers in degrees scaled by 64, with positiveindicating counterclockwise motion and negative indicatingclockwise motion. The start of the arc is specified byangle1 relative to the three-o&rsquo;clock position from thecenter of the rectangle, and the path and extent of the arcis specified by angle2 relative to the start of the arc. Ifthe magnitude of angle2 is greater than 360 degrees, it istruncated to 360 degrees. The x and y coordinates of therectangle are relative to the origin of the drawable. Foran arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the origin of the majorand minor axes is at [x+(w/2),y+(h/2)], and the infinitelythin path describing the entire circle/ellipse intersectsthe horizontal axis at [x,y+(h/2)] and [x+w,y+(h/2)] andintersects the vertical axis at [x+(w/2),y] and[x+(w/2),y+h]. These coordinates are not necessarilyintegral; that is, they are not truncated to discretecoordinates.For a wide line with line-width lw, the ideal boundingoutlines for filling are given by the two infinitely thinpaths consisting of all points whose perpendicular distancefrom a tangent to the path of the circle/ellipse is equal tolw/2 (which may be a fractional value). When the width andheight of the arc are not equal and both are nonzero, thenthe actual bounding outlines are implementation dependent.However, the computation of the shape and position of thebounding outlines (relative to the center of the arc) onlydepends on the width and height of the arc and theline-width.The cap-style is applied the same as for a linecorresponding to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at theendpoint. When the angle of an arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, and the width and height of the arcare both are nonzero, then the shape and position of the capat that face is implementation dependent. However, for aButt cap, the face is defined by a straight line, and thecomputation of the position (relative to the center of thearc) and the slope of the line only depends on the width andheight of the arc and the angle of the arc face. For othercap styles, the computation of the position (relative to thecenter of the arc) and the shape of the cap only depends onthe width and height of the arc, the line-width, the angleof the arc face, and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the arc from the endpoint.The join-style is applied the same as for two linescorresponding to the tangents of the circles/ellipses at thejoin point. When the width and height of both arcs arenonzero, and the angle of either arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, then the shape of the join isimplementation dependent. However, the computation of theshape only depends on the width and height of each arc, theline-width, the angles of the two arc faces, the direction(clockwise or counter clockwise) of the arcs from the joinpoint, and the relative orientation of the two arc centerpoints.For an arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the angles must bespecified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of theellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems areidentical). The relationship between these angles andangles expressed in the normal coordinate system of thescreen (as measured with a protractor) is as follows:skewed-angle = atan(tan(normal-angle) * w/h) + adjustThe skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians(rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range [0,2*PI).The atan returns a value in the range [&minus;PI/2,PI/2].

If the timeout value is nonzero,screen-saver is enabled. Once screen-saver is enabled, ifno input from the keyboard or pointer is generated fortimeout seconds, screen-saver is activated. For eachscreen, if blanking is preferred and the hardware supportsvideo blanking, the screen will simply go blank. Otherwise,if either exposures are allowed or the screen can beregenerated without sending exposure events to clients, thescreen is changed in a server-dependent fashion to avoidphosphor burn. Otherwise, the state of the screens does notchange, and screen-saver is not activated. At the nextkeyboard or pointer input or at the next ForceScreenSaverwith mode Reset, screen-saver is deactivated, and all screenstates are restored.If the server-dependent screen-saver method is amenable toperiodic change, interval serves as a hint about how longthe change period should be, with zero hinting that noperiodic change should be made.

When the access control mechanism isenabled and a client attempts to establish a connection tothe server, the host on which the client resides must be inthe access control list, or the client must have beengranted permission by a server-dependent method, or theserver will refuse the connection.The client must reside on the same host as the server and/orhave been granted permission by a server-dependent method toexecute this request (or an Access error results).An initial access control list can usually be specified,typically by naming a file that the server reads at startupand reset.The following address families are defined. A server is notrequired to support these families and may support familiesnot listed here. Use of an unsupported family, an improperaddress format, or an improper address length within asupported family results in a Value error.Note that use of a host address in the ChangeHosts requestis deprecated. It is only useful when a host has a unique,constant address, a requirement that is increasingly unmetas sites adopt dynamically assigned addresses, networkaddress translation gateways, IPv6 link local addresses, andvarious other technologies. It also assumes all users of ahost share equivalent access rights, and as such has neverbeen suitable for many multi-user machine environments.Instead, more secure forms of authentication, such as thosebased on shared secrets or public key encryption, arerecommended.For the Internet family, the address must be four byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The Internet family supports IP version 4 addresses only.For the InternetV6 family, the address must be sixteen byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The InternetV6 family supports IP version 6 addresses only.For the DECnet family, the server performs no automaticswapping on the address bytes. A Phase IV address is twobytes long: the first byte contains the least significanteight bits of the node number, and the second byte containsthe most significant two bits of the node number in theleast significant two bits of the byte and the area in themost significant six bits of the byte.For the Chaos family, the address must be two bytes long.The host number is always the first byte in the address, andthe subnet number is always the second byte. The serverperforms no automatic swapping on the address bytes.__&#9474; ListHosts&rarr;mode: {Enabled, Disabled}hosts: LISTofHOST&#9474;__ This request returns the hosts on the access control listand whether use of the list at connection setup is currentlyenabled or disabled.Each HOST is padded to a multiple of four bytes.__&#9474; SetAccessControlmode: {Enable, Disable}Errors: Access, Value&#9474;__ This request enables or disables the use of the accesscontrol list at connection setups.The client must reside on the same host as the server and/orhave been granted permission by a server-dependent method toexecute this request (or an Access error results).__&#9474; SetCloseDownModemode: {Destroy, RetainPermanent, RetainTemporary}Errors: Value&#9474;__ This request defines what will happen to the client&rsquo;sresources at connection close.

Connection CloseAt connection close, all event selections made by the clientare discarded. If the client has the pointer activelygrabbed, an UngrabPointer is performed. If the client hasthe keyboard actively grabbed, an UngrabKeyboard isperformed. All passive grabs by the client are released.If the client has the server grabbed, an UngrabServer isperformed. All selections (see SetSelectionOwner request)owned by the client are disowned. If close-down mode (seeSetCloseDownMode request) is RetainPermanent orRetainTemporary, then all resources (including colormapentries) allocated by the client are marked as permanent ortemporary, respectively (but this does not prevent otherclients from explicitly destroying them). If the mode isDestroy, all of the client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed.When a client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed, for each window inthe client&rsquo;s save-set, if the window is an inferior of awindow created by the client, the save-set window isreparented to the closest ancestor such that the save-setwindow is not an inferior of a window created by the client.If the save-set window is unmapped, a MapWindow request isperformed on it (even if it was not an inferior of a windowcreated by the client). The reparenting leaves unchangedthe absolute coordinates (with respect to the root window)of the upper-left outer corner of the save-set window.After save-set processing, all windows created by the clientare destroyed. For each nonwindow resource created by theclient, the appropriate Free request is performed. Allcolors and colormap entries allocated by the client arefreed.A server goes through a cycle of having no connections andhaving some connections. At every transition to the stateof having no connections as a result of a connection closingwith a Destroy close-down mode, the server resets its stateas if it had just been started. This starts by destroyingall lingering resources from clients that have terminated inRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode. It additionallyincludes deleting all but the predefined atom identifiers,deleting all properties on all root windows, resetting alldevice maps and attributes (key click, bell volume,acceleration), resetting the access control list, restoringthe standard root tiles and cursors, restoring the defaultfont path, and restoring the input focus to statePointerRoot.Note that closing a connection with a close-down mode ofRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary will not cause the serverto reset.11. EventsWhen a button press is processed with the pointer in somewindow W and no active pointer grab is in progress, theancestors of W are searched from the root down, looking fora passive grab to activate. If no matching passive grab onthe button exists, then an active grab is startedautomatically for the client receiving the event, and thelast-pointer-grab time is set to the current server time.The effect is essentially equivalent to a GrabButton witharguments:The grab is terminated automatically when the logical stateof the pointer has all buttons released. UngrabPointer andChangeActivePointerGrab can both be used to modify theactive grab.__&#9474; KeyPressKeyReleaseButtonPressButtonReleaseMotionNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16detail: &lt;see below&gt;state: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ These events are generated either when a key or buttonlogically changes state or when the pointer logically moves.The generation of these logical changes may lag the physicalchanges if device event processing is frozen. Note thatKeyPress and KeyRelease are generated for all keys, eventhose mapped to modifier bits. The source of the event isthe window the pointer is in. The window the event isreported with respect to is called the event window. Theevent window is found by starting with the source window andlooking up the hierarchy for the first window on which anyclient has selected interest in the event (provided nointervening window prohibits event generation by includingthe event type in its do-not-propagate-mask). The actualwindow used for reporting can be modified by active grabsand, in the case of keyboard events, can be modified by thefocus window.The root is the root window of the source window, and root-xand root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;sorigin at the time of the event. Event is the event window.If the event window is on the same screen as root, thenevent-x and event-y are the pointer coordinates relative tothe event window&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-yare zero. If the source window is an inferior of the eventwindow, then child is set to the child of the event windowthat is an ancestor of (or is) the source window.Otherwise, it is set to None. The state component gives thelogical state of the buttons and modifier keys just beforethe event. The detail component type varies with the eventtype:MotionNotify events are only generated when the motionbegins and ends in the window. The granularity of motionevents is not guaranteed, but a client selecting for motionevents is guaranteed to get at least one event when thepointer moves and comes to rest. Selecting PointerMotionreceives events independent of the state of the pointerbuttons. By selecting some subset of Button[1-5]Motioninstead, MotionNotify events will only be received when oneor more of the specified buttons are pressed. By selectingButtonMotion, MotionNotify events will be received only whenat least one button is pressed. The events are always oftype MotionNotify, independent of the selection. IfPointerMotionHint is selected, the server is free to sendonly one MotionNotify event (with detail Hint) to the clientfor the event window until either the key or button statechanges, the pointer leaves the event window, or the clientissues a QueryPointer or GetMotionEvents request.__&#9474; EnterNotifyLeaveNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16mode: {Normal, Grab, Ungrab}detail: {Ancestor, Virtual, Inferior, Nonlinear,NonlinearVirtual}focus: BOOLstate: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ If pointer motion or window hierarchy change causes thepointer to be in a different window than before, EnterNotifyand LeaveNotify events are generated instead of aMotionNotify event.

The rootis the root window for this position, and root-x and root-yare the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;s origin at thetime of the event. Event is the event window. If the eventwindow is on the same screen as root, then event-x andevent-y are the pointer coordinates relative to the eventwindow&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-y are zero.In a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the event windowcontains the initial position of the pointer, then the childcomponent is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None. Foran EnterNotify event, if a child of the event windowcontains the final pointer position, then the childcomponent is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None.

The format specifies whether the datashould be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bitquantities, so that the server can correctly byte-swap, asnecessary. The data always consists of either 20 8-bitvalues or 10 16-bit values or 5 32-bit values, althoughparticular message types might not make use of all of thesevalues.12. Flow Control and ConcurrencyWhenever the server is writing to a given connection, it ispermissible for the server to stop reading from thatconnection (but if the writing would block, it must continueto service other connections). The server is not requiredto buffer more than a single request per connection at onetime. For a given connection to the server, a client canblock while reading from the connection but should undertaketo read (events and errors) when writing would block.Failure on the part of a client to obey this rule couldresult in a deadlocked connection, although deadlock isprobably unlikely unless either the transport layer has verylittle buffering or the client attempts to send largenumbers of requests without ever reading replies or checkingfor errors and events.Whether or not a server is implemented with internalconcurrency, the overall effect must be as if individualrequests are executed to completion in some serial order,and requests from a given connection must be executed indelivery order (that is, the total execution order is ashuffle of the individual streams). The execution of arequest includes validating all arguments, collecting alldata for any reply, and generating and queueing all requiredevents. However, it does not include the actualtransmission of the reply and the events. In addition, theeffect of any other cause that can generate multiple events(for example, activation of a grab or pointer motion) musteffectively generate and queue all required eventsindivisibly with respect to all other causes and requests.For a request from a given client, any events destined forthat client that are caused by executing the request must besent to the client before any reply or error is sent.1"></a>
<h2>9. Requests__&#9474; CreateWindowwid, parent: WINDOWclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly, CopyFromParent}depth: CARD8visual: VISUALID or CopyFromParentx, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16value-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Colormap, Cursor, IDChoice, Match, Pixmap,Value, Window&#9474;__ This request creates an unmapped window and assigns theidentifier wid to it.A class of CopyFromParent means the class is taken from theparent. A depth of zero for class InputOutput orCopyFromParent means the depth is taken from the parent. Avisual of CopyFromParent means the visual type is taken fromthe parent. For class InputOutput, the visual type anddepth must be a combination supported for the screen (or aMatch error results). The depth need not be the same as theparent, but the parent must not be of class InputOnly (or aMatch error results). For class InputOnly, the depth mustbe zero (or a Match error results), and the visual must beone supported for the screen (or a Match error results).However, the parent can have any depth and class.The server essentially acts as if InputOnly windows do notexist for the purposes of graphics requests, exposureprocessing, and VisibilityNotify events. An InputOnlywindow cannot be used as a drawable (as a source ordestination for graphics requests). InputOnly andInputOutput windows act identically in otherrespects&minus;properties, grabs, input control, and so on.The coordinate system has the X axis horizontal and the Yaxis vertical with the origin [0, 0] at the upper-leftcorner. Coordinates are integral, in terms of pixels, andcoincide with pixel centers. Each window and pixmap has itsown coordinate system. For a window, the origin is insidethe border at the inside, upper-left corner.The x and y coordinates for the window are relative to theparent&rsquo;s origin and specify the position of the upper-leftouter corner of the window (not the origin). The width andheight specify the inside size (not including the border)and must be nonzero (or a Value error results). Theborder-width for an InputOnly window must be zero (or aMatch error results).The window is placed on top in the stacking order withrespect to siblings.The value-mask and value-list specify attributes of thewindow that are to be explicitly initialized. The possiblevalues are:The default values when attributes are not explicitlyinitialized are:Only the following attributes are defined for InputOnlywindows:&bull; win-gravity&bull; event-mask&bull; do-not-propagate-mask&bull; override-redirect&bull; cursorIt is a Match error to specify any other attributes forInputOnly windows.If background-pixmap is given, it overrides the defaultbackground-pixmap. The background pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If background None is specified,the window has no defined background. If backgroundParentRelative is specified, the parent&rsquo;s background isused, but the window must have the same depth as the parent(or a Match error results). If the parent has backgroundNone, then the window will also have background None. Acopy of the parent&rsquo;s background is not made. The parent&rsquo;sbackground is reexamined each time the window background isrequired. If background-pixel is given, it overrides thedefault background-pixmap and any background-pixmap givenexplicitly, and a pixmap of undefined size filled withbackground-pixel is used for the background. Range checkingis not performed on the background-pixel value; it is simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits. For aParentRelative background, the background tile origin alwaysaligns with the parent&rsquo;s background tile origin. Otherwise,the background tile origin is always the window origin.When no valid contents are available for regions of a windowand the regions are either visible or the server ismaintaining backing store, the server automatically tilesthe regions with the window&rsquo;s background unless the windowhas a background of None. If the background is None, theprevious screen contents from other windows of the samedepth as the window are simply left in place if the contentscome from the parent of the window or an inferior of theparent; otherwise, the initial contents of the exposedregions are undefined. Exposure events are then generatedfor the regions, even if the background is None.The border tile origin is always the same as the backgroundtile origin. If border-pixmap is given, it overrides thedefault border-pixmap. The border pixmap and the windowmust have the same root and the same depth (or a Match errorresults). Any size pixmap can be used, although some sizesmay be faster than others. If CopyFromParent is given, theparent&rsquo;s border pixmap is copied (subsequent changes to theparent&rsquo;s border attribute do not affect the child), but thewindow must have the same depth as the parent (or a Matcherror results). The pixmap might be copied by sharing thesame pixmap object between the child and parent or by makinga complete copy of the pixmap contents. If border-pixel isgiven, it overrides the default border-pixmap and anyborder-pixmap given explicitly, and a pixmap of undefinedsize filled with border-pixel is used for the border. Rangechecking is not performed on the border-pixel value; it issimply truncated to the appropriate number of bits.Output to a window is always clipped to the inside of thewindow, so that the border is never affected.The bit-gravity defines which region of the window should beretained if the window is resized, and win-gravity defineshow the window should be repositioned if the parent isresized (see ConfigureWindow request).A backing-store of WhenMapped advises the server thatmaintaining contents of obscured regions when the window ismapped would be beneficial. A backing-store of Alwaysadvises the server that maintaining contents even when thewindow is unmapped would be beneficial. In this case, theserver may generate an exposure event when the window iscreated. A value of NotUseful advises the server thatmaintaining contents is unnecessary, although a server maystill choose to maintain contents while the window ismapped. Note that if the server maintains contents, thenthe server should maintain complete contents not just theregion within the parent boundaries, even if the window islarger than its parent. While the server maintainscontents, exposure events will not normally be generated,but the server may stop maintaining contents at any time.If save-under is True, the server is advised that when thiswindow is mapped, saving the contents of windows it obscureswould be beneficial.When the contents of obscured regions of a window are beingmaintained, regions obscured by noninferior windows areincluded in the destination (and source, when the window isthe source) of graphics requests, but regions obscured byinferior windows are not included.The backing-planes indicates (with bits set to 1) which bitplanes of the window hold dynamic data that must bepreserved in backing-stores and during save-unders. Thebacking-pixel specifies what value to use in planes notcovered by backing-planes. The server is free to save onlythe specified bit planes in the backing-store or save-underand regenerate the remaining planes with the specified pixelvalue. Any bits beyond the specified depth of the window inthese values are simply ignored.The event-mask defines which events the client is interestedin for this window (or for some event types, inferiors ofthe window). The do-not-propagate-mask defines which eventsshould not be propagated to ancestor windows when no clienthas the event type selected in this window.The override-redirect specifies whether map and configurerequests on this window should override aSubstructureRedirect on the parent, typically to inform awindow manager not to tamper with the window.The colormap specifies the colormap that best reflects thetrue colors of the window. Servers capable of supportingmultiple hardware colormaps may use this information, andwindow managers may use it for InstallColormap requests.The colormap must have the same visual type and root as thewindow (or a Match error results). If CopyFromParent isspecified, the parent&rsquo;s colormap is copied (subsequentchanges to the parent&rsquo;s colormap attribute do not affect thechild). However, the window must have the same visual typeas the parent (or a Match error results), and the parentmust not have a colormap of None (or a Match error results).For an explanation of None, see FreeColormap request. Thecolormap is copied by sharing the colormap object betweenthe child and the parent, not by making a complete copy ofthe colormap contents.If a cursor is specified, it will be used whenever thepointer is in the window. If None is specified, theparent&rsquo;s cursor will be used when the pointer is in thewindow, and any change in the parent&rsquo;s cursor will cause animmediate change in the displayed cursor.This request generates a CreateNotify event.The background and border pixmaps and the cursor may befreed immediately if no further explicit references to themare to be made.Subsequent drawing into the background or border pixmap hasan undefined effect on the window state. The server mightor might not make a copy of the pixmap.__&#9474; ChangeWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Access, Colormap, Cursor, Match, Pixmap, Value,Window&#9474;__ The value-mask and value-list specify which attributes areto be changed. The values and restrictions are the same asfor CreateWindow.Setting a new background, whether by background-pixmap orbackground-pixel, overrides any previous background.Setting a new border, whether by border-pixel orborder-pixmap, overrides any previous border.Changing the background does not cause the window contentsto be changed. Setting the border or changing thebackground such that the border tile origin changes causesthe border to be repainted. Changing the background of aroot window to None or ParentRelative restores the defaultbackground pixmap. Changing the border of a root window toCopyFromParent restores the default border pixmap.Changing the win-gravity does not affect the currentposition of the window.Changing the backing-store of an obscured window toWhenMapped or Always or changing the backing-planes,backing-pixel, or save-under of a mapped window may have noimmediate effect.Multiple clients can select input on the same window; theirevent-masks are disjoint. When an event is generated, itwill be reported to all interested clients. However, onlyone client at a time can select for SubstructureRedirect,only one client at a time can select for ResizeRedirect, andonly one client at a time can select for ButtonPress. Anattempt to violate these restrictions results in an Accesserror.There is only one do-not-propagate-mask for a window, notone per client.Changing the colormap of a window (by defining a new map,not by changing the contents of the existing map) generatesa ColormapNotify event. Changing the colormap of a visiblewindow might have no immediate effect on the screen (seeInstallColormap request).Changing the cursor of a root window to None restores thedefault cursor.The order in which attributes are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of theattributes may have been altered.__&#9474; GetWindowAttributeswindow: WINDOW&rarr;visual: VISUALIDclass: {InputOutput, InputOnly}bit-gravity: BITGRAVITYwin-gravity: WINGRAVITYbacking-store: {NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always}backing-planes: CARD32backing-pixel: CARD32save-under: BOOLcolormap: COLORMAP or Nonemap-is-installed: BOOLmap-state: {Unmapped, Unviewable, Viewable}all-event-masks, your-event-mask: SETofEVENTdo-not-propagate-mask: SETofDEVICEEVENToverride-redirect: BOOLErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request returns the current attributes of the window.A window is Unviewable if it is mapped but some ancestor isunmapped.

The window and all inferiors arethen destroyed, and a DestroyNotify event is generated foreach window. The ordering of the DestroyNotify events issuch that for any given window, DestroyNotify is generatedon all inferiors of the window before being generated on thewindow itself. The ordering among siblings and acrosssubhierarchies is not otherwise constrained.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed.If the window is a root window, this request has no effect.__&#9474; DestroySubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs a DestroyWindow request on allchildren of the window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.__&#9474; ChangeSaveSetwindow: WINDOWmode: {Insert, Delete}Errors:Match, Value, Window&#9474;__ This request adds or removes the specified window from theclient&rsquo;s save-set. The window must have been created bysome other client (or a Match error results). For furtherinformation about the use of the save-set, see section 10.When windows are destroyed, the server automatically removesthem from the save-set.__&#9474; ReparentWindowwindow, parent: WINDOWx, y: INT16Errors: Match, Window&#9474;__ If the window is mapped, an UnmapWindow request is performedautomatically first. The window is then removed from itscurrent position in the hierarchy and is inserted as a childof the specified parent. The x and y coordinates arerelative to the parent&rsquo;s origin and specify the new positionof the upper-left outer corner of the window. The window isplaced on top in the stacking order with respect tosiblings. A ReparentNotify event is then generated. Theoverride-redirect attribute of the window is passed on inthis event; a value of True indicates that a window managershould not tamper with this window. Finally, if the windowwas originally mapped, a MapWindow request is performedautomatically.Normal exposure processing on formerly obscured windows isperformed. The server might not generate exposure eventsfor regions from the initial unmap that are immediatelyobscured by the final map.A Match error is generated if:&bull; The new parent is not on the same screen as the oldparent.&bull; The new parent is the window itself or an inferior ofthe window.&bull; The new parent is InputOnly, and the window is not.&bull; The window has a ParentRelative background, and the newparent is not the same depth as the window.__&#9474; MapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already mapped, this request has no effect.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, then a MapRequest event is generated, but thewindow remains unmapped. Otherwise, the window is mapped,and a MapNotify event is generated.If the window is now viewable and its contents have beendiscarded, the window is tiled with its background (if nobackground is defined, the existing screen contents are notaltered), and zero or more exposure events are generated.If a backing-store has been maintained while the window wasunmapped, no exposure events are generated. If abacking-store will now be maintained, a full-window exposureis always generated. Otherwise, only visible regions may bereported. Similar tiling and exposure take place for anynewly viewable inferiors.__&#9474; MapSubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs a MapWindow request on all unmappedchildren of the window, in top-to-bottom stacking order.__&#9474; UnmapWindowwindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ If the window is already unmapped, this request has noeffect. Otherwise, the window is unmapped, and anUnmapNotify event is generated. Normal exposure processingon formerly obscured windows is performed.__&#9474; UnmapSubwindowswindow: WINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request performs an UnmapWindow request on all mappedchildren of the window, in bottom-to-top stacking order.__&#9474; ConfigureWindowwindow: WINDOWvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Match, Value, Window&#9474;__ This request changes the configuration of the window. Thevalue-mask and value-list specify which values are to begiven. The possible values are:The x and y coordinates are relative to the parent&rsquo;s originand specify the position of the upper-left outer corner ofthe window. The width and height specify the inside size,not including the border, and must be nonzero (or a Valueerror results). Those values not specified are taken fromthe existing geometry of the window. Note that changingjust the border-width leaves the outer-left corner of thewindow in a fixed position but moves the absolute positionof the window&rsquo;s origin. It is a Match error to attempt tomake the border-width of an InputOnly window nonzero.If the override-redirect attribute of the window is Falseand some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe parent, a ConfigureRequest event is generated, and nofurther processing is performed. Otherwise, the followingis performed:If some other client has selected ResizeRedirect on thewindow and the inside width or height of the window is beingchanged, a ResizeRequest event is generated, and the currentinside width and height are used instead. Note that theoverride-redirect attribute of the window has no effect onResizeRedirect and that SubstructureRedirect on the parenthas precedence over ResizeRedirect on the window.The geometry of the window is changed as specified, thewindow is restacked among siblings, and a ConfigureNotifyevent is generated if the state of the window actuallychanges. If the inside width or height of the window hasactually changed, then children of the window are affected,according to their win-gravity. Exposure processing isperformed on formerly obscured windows (including the windowitself and its inferiors if regions of them were obscuredbut now are not). Exposure processing is also performed onany new regions of the window (as a result of increasing thewidth or height) and on any regions where window contentsare lost.If the inside width or height of a window is not changed butthe window is moved or its border is changed, then thecontents of the window are not lost but move with thewindow. Changing the inside width or height of the windowcauses its contents to be moved or lost, depending on thebit-gravity of the window. It also causes children to bereconfigured, depending on their win-gravity. For a changeof width and height of W and H, we define the [x, y] pairsas:When a window with one of these bit-gravities is resized,the corresponding pair defines the change in position ofeach pixel in the window. When a window with one of thesewin-gravities has its parent window resized, thecorresponding pair defines the change in position of thewindow within the parent. This repositioning generates aGravityNotify event. GravityNotify events are generatedafter the ConfigureNotify event is generated.A gravity of Static indicates that the contents or originshould not move relative to the origin of the root window.If the change in size of the window is coupled with a changein position of [X, Y], then for bit-gravity the change inposition of each pixel is [&minus;X, &minus;Y] and for win-gravity thechange in position of a child when its parent is so resizedis [&minus;X, &minus;Y]. Note that Static gravity still only takeseffect when the width or height of the window is changed,not when the window is simply moved.A bit-gravity of Forget indicates that the window contentsare always discarded after a size change, even ifbacking-store or save-under has been requested. The windowis tiled with its background (except, if no background isdefined, the existing screen contents are not altered) andzero or more exposure events are generated.The contents and borders of inferiors are not affected bytheir parent&rsquo;s bit-gravity. A server is permitted to ignorethe specified bit-gravity and use Forget instead.A win-gravity of Unmap is like NorthWest, but the child isalso unmapped when the parent is resized, and an UnmapNotifyevent is generated. UnmapNotify events are generated afterthe ConfigureNotify event is generated.If a sibling and a stack-mode are specified, the window isrestacked as follows:If a stack-mode is specified but no sibling is specified,the window is restacked as follows:It is a Match error if a sibling is specified without astack-mode or if the window is not actually a sibling.Note that the computations for BottomIf, TopIf, and Oppositeare performed with respect to the window&rsquo;s final geometry(as controlled by the other arguments to the request), notto its initial geometry.Attempts to configure a root window have no effect.__&#9474; CirculateWindowwindow: WINDOWdirection: {RaiseLowest, LowerHighest}Errors: Value, Window&#9474;__ If some other client has selected SubstructureRedirect onthe window, then a CirculateRequest event is generated, andno further processing is performed. Otherwise, thefollowing is performed, and then a CirculateNotify event isgenerated if the window is actually restacked.For RaiseLowest, CirculateWindow raises the lowest mappedchild (if any) that is occluded by another child to the topof the stack. For LowerHighest, CirculateWindow lowers thehighest mapped child (if any) that occludes another child tothe bottom of the stack. Exposure processing is performedon formerly obscured windows.__&#9474; GetGeometrydrawable: DRAWABLE&rarr;root: WINDOWdepth: CARD8x, y: INT16width, height, border-width: CARD16Errors: Drawable&#9474;__ This request returns the root and current geometry of thedrawable. The depth is the number of bits per pixel for theobject. The x, y, and border-width will always be zero forpixmaps. For a window, the x and y coordinates specify theupper-left outer corner of the window relative to itsparent&rsquo;s origin, and the width and height specify the insidesize, not including the border.It is legal to pass an InputOnly window as a drawable tothis request.__&#9474; QueryTreewindow: WINDOW&rarr;root: WINDOWparent: WINDOW or Nonechildren: LISTofWINDOWErrors: Window&#9474;__ This request returns the root, the parent, and the childrenof the window.

If the mode is Prepend or Append, then the typeand format must match the existing property value (or aMatch error results). If the property is undefined, it istreated as defined with the correct type and format withzero-length data. For Prepend, the data is tacked on to thebeginning of the existing data, and for Append, it is tackedon to the end of the existing data.This request generates a PropertyNotify event on the window.The lifetime of a property is not tied to the storingclient.

The gcontext can be used with anydestination drawable having the same root and depth as thespecified drawable; use with other drawables results in aMatch error.The value-mask and value-list specify which components areto be explicitly initialized. The context components are:&nbsp;&nbsp;In graphics operations, given a source and destinationpixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bitsof the pixels; that is, a Boolean operation is performed ineach bit plane. The plane-mask restricts the operation to asubset of planes, so the result is:((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))Range checking is not performed on the values forforeground, background, or plane-mask. They are simplytruncated to the appropriate number of bits.The meanings of the functions are:The line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater thanor equal to one, a wide line, or the special value zero, athin line.Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by thegraphics request. Unless otherwise specified by the join orcap style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints[x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle with verticesat the following real coordinates:[x1&minus;(w*sn/2), y1+(w*cs/2)], [x1+(w*sn/2), y1&minus;(w*cs/2)],[x2&minus;(w*sn/2), y2+(w*cs/2)], [x2+(w*sn/2), y2&minus;(w*cs/2)]The sn is the sine of the angle of the line and cs is thecosine of the angle of the line. A pixel is part of theline (and hence drawn) if the center of the pixel is fullyinside the bounding box, which is viewed as havinginfinitely thin edges. If the center of the pixel isexactly on the bounding box, it is part of the line if andonly if the interior is immediately to its right (xincreasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontaledge are a special case and are part of the line if and onlyif the interior or the boundary is immediately below (yincreasing direction) and if the interior or the boundary isimmediately to the right (x increasing direction). Notethat this description is a mathematical model describing thepixels that are drawn for a wide line and does not implythat trigonometry is required to implement such a model.Real or fixed point arithmetic is recommended for computingthe corners of the line endpoints for lines greater than onepixel in width.Thin lines (zero line-width) are nominally one pixel widelines drawn using an unspecified, device-dependentalgorithm. There are only two constraints on thisalgorithm. First, if a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1]to [x2,y2] and another line is drawn unclipped from[x1+dx,y1+dy] to [x2+dx,y2+dy], then a point [x,y] istouched by drawing the first line if and only if the point[x+dx,y+dy] is touched by drawing the second line. Second,the effective set of points comprising a line cannot beaffected by clipping. Thus, a point is touched in a clippedline if and only if the point lies inside the clippingregion and the point would be touched by the line when drawnunclipped.Note that a wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] alwaysdraws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to[x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style.Implementors are encouraged to make this property true forthin lines, but it is not required. A line-width of zeromay differ from a line-width of one in which pixels aredrawn. In general, drawing a thin line will be faster thandrawing a wide line of width one, but thin lines may not mixwell aesthetically with wide lines because of the differentdrawing algorithms. If it is desirable to obtain preciseand uniform results across all displays, a client shouldalways use a line-width of one, rather than a line-width ofzero.The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the semanticsdepends on the line-width and the cap-style:For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), whenthe join-style is applied at one or both endpoints, theeffect is as if the line was removed from the overall path.However, if the total path consists of (or is reduced to) asingle point joined with itself, the effect is the same aswhen the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensionalplane with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions.When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in agraphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instanceof the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within thedrawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. Thetile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative tothe origin of whatever destination drawable is specified ina graphics request.The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as thegcontext (or a Match error results). The stipple pixmapmust have depth one and must have the same root as thegcontext (or a Match error results). For fill-styleStippled (but not fill-style OpaqueStippled), the stipplepattern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an additionalclip mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask. Any size pixmapcan be used for tiling or stippling, although some sizes maybe faster to use than others.The fill-style defines the contents of the source for line,text, and fill requests. For all text and fill requests(for example, PolyText8, PolyText16, PolyFillRectangle,FillPoly, and PolyFillArc) as well as for line requests withline-style Solid, (for example, PolyLine, PolySegment,PolyRectangle, PolyArc) and for the even dashes for linerequests with line-style OnOffDash or DoubleDash:For the odd dashes for line requests with line-styleDoubleDash:The dashes value allowed here is actually a simplified formof the more general patterns that can be set with SetDashes.Specifying a value of N here is equivalent to specifying thetwo element list [N, N] in SetDashes. The value must benonzero (or a Value error results). The meaning ofdash-offset and dashes are explained in the SetDashesrequest.The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable.Only pixels where the clip-mask has bits set to 1 are drawn.Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered by theclip-mask or where the clip-mask has bits set to 0. Theclip-mask affects all graphics requests, but it does notclip sources. The clip-mask origin is interpreted relativeto the origin of whatever destination drawable is specifiedin a graphics request. If a pixmap is specified as theclip-mask, it must have depth 1 and have the same root asthe gcontext (or a Match error results). If clip-mask isNone, then pixels are always drawn, regardless of the cliporigin. The clip-mask can also be set with theSetClipRectangles request.For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows areadditionally clipped by all viewable InputOutput children.For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination windowis clipped by inferiors. This will result in includingsubwindow contents in the source and drawing throughsubwindow boundaries of the destination. The use ofIncludeInferiors with a source or destination window of onedepth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is notillegal, but the semantics is undefined by the coreprotocol.The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (that is, aredrawn) for paths given in FillPoly requests. EvenOdd meansa point is inside if an infinite ray with the point asorigin crosses the path an odd number of times. ForWinding, a point is inside if an infinite ray with the pointas origin crosses an unequal number of clockwise andcounterclockwise directed path segments. A clockwisedirected path segment is one that crosses the ray from leftto right as observed from the point. A counter-clockwisesegment is one that crosses the ray from right to left asobserved from the point. The case where a directed linesegment is coincident with the ray is uninteresting becauseone can simply choose a different ray that is not coincidentwith a segment.For both fill rules, a point is infinitely small and thepath is an infinitely thin line. A pixel is inside if thecenter point of the pixel is inside and the center point isnot on the boundary. If the center point is on theboundary, the pixel is inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately to its right (x increasingdirection). Pixels with centers along a horizontal edge area special case and are inside if and only if the polygoninterior is immediately below (y increasing direction).The arc-mode controls filling in the PolyFillArc request.The graphics-exposures flag controls GraphicsExposure eventgeneration for CopyArea and CopyPlane requests (and anysimilar requests defined by extensions).The default component values are:Storing a pixmap in a gcontext might or might not result ina copy being made. If the pixmap is later used as thedestination for a graphics request, the change might ormight not be reflected in the gcontext. If the pixmap isused simultaneously in a graphics request as both adestination and as a tile or stipple, the results are notdefined.It is quite likely that some amount of gcontext informationwill be cached in display hardware and that such hardwarecan only cache a small number of gcontexts. Given thenumber and complexity of components, clients should viewswitching between gcontexts with nearly identical state assignificantly more expensive than making minor changes to asingle gcontext.__&#9474; ChangeGCgc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKvalue-list: LISTofVALUEErrors: Alloc, Font, GContext, Match, Pixmap, Value&#9474;__ This request changes components in gc. The value-mask andvalue-list specify which components are to be changed. Thevalues and restrictions are the same as for CreateGC.Changing the clip-mask also overrides any previousSetClipRectangles request on the context. Changingdash-offset or dashes overrides any previous SetDashesrequest on the context.The order in which components are verified and altered isserver-dependent. If an error is generated, a subset of thecomponents may have been altered.__&#9474; CopyGCsrc-gc, dst-gc: GCONTEXTvalue-mask: BITMASKErrors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request copies components from src-gc to dst-gc.

Dashes cannot be empty (or a Value errorresults). Specifying an odd-length list is equivalent tospecifying the same list concatenated with itself to producean even-length list. The initial and alternating elementsof dashes are the even dashes; the others are the odddashes. Each element specifies a dash length in pixels.All of the elements must be nonzero (or a Value errorresults). The dash-offset defines the phase of the pattern,specifying how many pixels into dashes the pattern shouldactually begin in any single graphics request. Dashing iscontinuous through path elements combined with a join-stylebut is reset to the dash-offset between each sequence ofjoined lines.The unit of measure for dashes is the same as in theordinary coordinate system. Ideally, a dash length ismeasured along the slope of the line, but implementationsare only required to match this ideal for horizontal andvertical lines. Failing the ideal semantics, it issuggested that the length be measured along the major axisof the line. The major axis is defined as the x axis forlines drawn at an angle of between &minus;45 and +45 degrees orbetween 135 and 225 degrees from the x axis. For all otherlines, the major axis is the y axis.For any graphics primitive, the computation of the endpointof an individual dash only depends on the geometry of theprimitive, the start position of the dash, the direction ofthe dash, and the dash length.For any graphics primitive, the total set of pixels used torender the primitive (both even and odd numbered dashelements) with DoubleDash line-style is the same as the setof pixels used to render the primitive with Solidline-style.For any graphics primitive, if the primitive is drawn withOnOffDash or DoubleDash line-style unclipped at position[x,y] and again at position [x+dx,y+dy], then a point[x1,y1] is included in a dash in the first instance if andonly if the point [x1+dx,y1+dy] is included in the dash inthe second instance. In addition, the effective set ofpoints comprising a dash cannot be affected by clipping. Apoint is included in a clipped dash if and only if the pointlies inside the clipping region and the point would beincluded in the dash when drawn unclipped.__&#9474; SetClipRectanglesgc: GCONTEXTclip-x-origin, clip-y-origin: INT16rectangles: LISTofRECTANGLEordering: {UnSorted, YSorted, YXSorted, YXBanded}Errors: Alloc, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request changes clip-mask in gc to the specified listof rectangles and sets the clip origin.

Each arc isspecified by a rectangle and two angles. The angles aresigned integers in degrees scaled by 64, with positiveindicating counterclockwise motion and negative indicatingclockwise motion. The start of the arc is specified byangle1 relative to the three-o&rsquo;clock position from thecenter of the rectangle, and the path and extent of the arcis specified by angle2 relative to the start of the arc. Ifthe magnitude of angle2 is greater than 360 degrees, it istruncated to 360 degrees. The x and y coordinates of therectangle are relative to the origin of the drawable. Foran arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the origin of the majorand minor axes is at [x+(w/2),y+(h/2)], and the infinitelythin path describing the entire circle/ellipse intersectsthe horizontal axis at [x,y+(h/2)] and [x+w,y+(h/2)] andintersects the vertical axis at [x+(w/2),y] and[x+(w/2),y+h]. These coordinates are not necessarilyintegral; that is, they are not truncated to discretecoordinates.For a wide line with line-width lw, the ideal boundingoutlines for filling are given by the two infinitely thinpaths consisting of all points whose perpendicular distancefrom a tangent to the path of the circle/ellipse is equal tolw/2 (which may be a fractional value). When the width andheight of the arc are not equal and both are nonzero, thenthe actual bounding outlines are implementation dependent.However, the computation of the shape and position of thebounding outlines (relative to the center of the arc) onlydepends on the width and height of the arc and theline-width.The cap-style is applied the same as for a linecorresponding to the tangent of the circle/ellipse at theendpoint. When the angle of an arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, and the width and height of the arcare both are nonzero, then the shape and position of the capat that face is implementation dependent. However, for aButt cap, the face is defined by a straight line, and thecomputation of the position (relative to the center of thearc) and the slope of the line only depends on the width andheight of the arc and the angle of the arc face. For othercap styles, the computation of the position (relative to thecenter of the arc) and the shape of the cap only depends onthe width and height of the arc, the line-width, the angleof the arc face, and the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the arc from the endpoint.The join-style is applied the same as for two linescorresponding to the tangents of the circles/ellipses at thejoin point. When the width and height of both arcs arenonzero, and the angle of either arc face is not an integralmultiple of 90 degrees, then the shape of the join isimplementation dependent. However, the computation of theshape only depends on the width and height of each arc, theline-width, the angles of the two arc faces, the direction(clockwise or counter clockwise) of the arcs from the joinpoint, and the relative orientation of the two arc centerpoints.For an arc specified as [x,y,w,h,a1,a2], the angles must bespecified in the effectively skewed coordinate system of theellipse (for a circle, the angles and coordinate systems areidentical). The relationship between these angles andangles expressed in the normal coordinate system of thescreen (as measured with a protractor) is as follows:skewed-angle = atan(tan(normal-angle) * w/h) + adjustThe skewed-angle and normal-angle are expressed in radians(rather than in degrees scaled by 64) in the range [0,2*PI).The atan returns a value in the range [&minus;PI/2,PI/2]. Theadjust is:The arcs are drawn in the order listed. If the last pointin one arc coincides with the first point in the followingarc, the two arcs will join correctly.

If two arcs joincorrectly and the line-width is greater than zero and thearcs intersect, no pixel is drawn more than once.Otherwise, the intersecting pixels of intersecting arcs aredrawn multiple times. Specifying an arc with one endpointand a clockwise extent draws the same pixels as specifyingthe other endpoint and an equivalent counterclockwiseextent, except as it affects joins.By specifying one axis to be zero, a horizontal or verticalline can be drawn.Angles are computed based solely on the coordinate system,ignoring the aspect ratio.GC components: function, plane-mask, line-width, line-style,cap-style, join-style, fill-style, subwindow-mode,clip-x-origin, clip-y-origin, clip-maskGC mode-dependent components: foreground, background, tile,stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, tile-stipple-y-origin,dash-offset, dashes__&#9474; FillPolydrawable: DRAWABLEgc: GCONTEXTshape: {Complex, Nonconvex, Convex}coordinate-mode: {Origin, Previous}points: LISTofPOINTErrors: Drawable, GContext, Match, Value&#9474;__ This request fills the region closed by the specified path.The path is closed automatically if the last point in thelist does not coincide with the first point.

Theacceleration is a multiplier for movement expressed as afraction. For example, specifying 3/1 means the pointermoves three times as fast as normal. The fraction can berounded arbitrarily by the server. Acceleration only takeseffect if the pointer moves more than threshold number ofpixels at once and only applies to the amount beyond thethreshold. Setting a value to &minus;1 restores the default.Other negative values generate a Value error, as does a zerovalue for acceleration-denominator.__&#9474; GetPointerControl&rarr;acceleration-numerator, acceleration-denominator: CARD16threshold: CARD16&#9474;__ This request returns the current acceleration and thresholdfor the pointer.__&#9474; SetScreenSavertimeout, interval: INT16prefer-blanking: {Yes, No, Default}allow-exposures: {Yes, No, Default}Errors: Value&#9474;__ The timeout and interval are specified in seconds; setting avalue to &minus;1 restores the default. Other negative valuesgenerate a Value error. If the timeout value is zero,screen-saver is disabled (but an activated screen-saver isnot deactivated). If the timeout value is nonzero,screen-saver is enabled. Once screen-saver is enabled, ifno input from the keyboard or pointer is generated fortimeout seconds, screen-saver is activated. For eachscreen, if blanking is preferred and the hardware supportsvideo blanking, the screen will simply go blank. Otherwise,if either exposures are allowed or the screen can beregenerated without sending exposure events to clients, thescreen is changed in a server-dependent fashion to avoidphosphor burn. Otherwise, the state of the screens does notchange, and screen-saver is not activated. At the nextkeyboard or pointer input or at the next ForceScreenSaverwith mode Reset, screen-saver is deactivated, and all screenstates are restored.If the server-dependent screen-saver method is amenable toperiodic change, interval serves as a hint about how longthe change period should be, with zero hinting that noperiodic change should be made. Examples of ways to changethe screen include scrambling the color map periodically,moving an icon image about the screen periodically, ortiling the screen with the root window background tile,randomly reorigined periodically.__&#9474; GetScreenSaver&rarr;timeout, interval: CARD16prefer-blanking: {Yes, No}allow-exposures: {Yes, No}&#9474;__ This request returns the current screen-saver controlvalues.__&#9474; ForceScreenSavermode: {Activate, Reset}Errors: Value&#9474;__ If the mode is Activate and screen-saver is currentlydeactivated, then screen-saver is activated (even ifscreen-saver has been disabled with a timeout value ofzero).

When the access control mechanism isenabled and a client attempts to establish a connection tothe server, the host on which the client resides must be inthe access control list, or the client must have beengranted permission by a server-dependent method, or theserver will refuse the connection.The client must reside on the same host as the server and/orhave been granted permission by a server-dependent method toexecute this request (or an Access error results).An initial access control list can usually be specified,typically by naming a file that the server reads at startupand reset.The following address families are defined. A server is notrequired to support these families and may support familiesnot listed here. Use of an unsupported family, an improperaddress format, or an improper address length within asupported family results in a Value error.Note that use of a host address in the ChangeHosts requestis deprecated. It is only useful when a host has a unique,constant address, a requirement that is increasingly unmetas sites adopt dynamically assigned addresses, networkaddress translation gateways, IPv6 link local addresses, andvarious other technologies. It also assumes all users of ahost share equivalent access rights, and as such has neverbeen suitable for many multi-user machine environments.Instead, more secure forms of authentication, such as thosebased on shared secrets or public key encryption, arerecommended.For the Internet family, the address must be four byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The Internet family supports IP version 4 addresses only.For the InternetV6 family, the address must be sixteen byteslong. The address bytes are in standard IP order; theserver performs no automatic swapping on the address bytes.The InternetV6 family supports IP version 6 addresses only.For the DECnet family, the server performs no automaticswapping on the address bytes. A Phase IV address is twobytes long: the first byte contains the least significanteight bits of the node number, and the second byte containsthe most significant two bits of the node number in theleast significant two bits of the byte and the area in themost significant six bits of the byte.For the Chaos family, the address must be two bytes long.The host number is always the first byte in the address, andthe subnet number is always the second byte. The serverperforms no automatic swapping on the address bytes.__&#9474; ListHosts&rarr;mode: {Enabled, Disabled}hosts: LISTofHOST&#9474;__ This request returns the hosts on the access control listand whether use of the list at connection setup is currentlyenabled or disabled.Each HOST is padded to a multiple of four bytes.__&#9474; SetAccessControlmode: {Enable, Disable}Errors: Access, Value&#9474;__ This request enables or disables the use of the accesscontrol list at connection setups.The client must reside on the same host as the server and/orhave been granted permission by a server-dependent method toexecute this request (or an Access error results).__&#9474; SetCloseDownModemode: {Destroy, RetainPermanent, RetainTemporary}Errors: Value&#9474;__ This request defines what will happen to the client&rsquo;sresources at connection close.

If theclient has already terminated in either RetainPermanent orRetainTemporary mode, all of the client&rsquo;s resources aredestroyed (see section 10). If AllTemporary is specified,then the resources of all clients that have terminated inRetainTemporary are destroyed.__&#9474; NoOperation&#9474;__ This request has no arguments and no results, but therequest length field allows the request to be any multipleof four bytes in length. The bytes contained in the requestare uninterpreted by the server.This request can be used in its minimum four byte form aspadding where necessary by client libraries that find itconvenient to force requests to begin on 64-bit boundaries.10. Connection CloseAt connection close, all event selections made by the clientare discarded. If the client has the pointer activelygrabbed, an UngrabPointer is performed. If the client hasthe keyboard actively grabbed, an UngrabKeyboard isperformed. All passive grabs by the client are released.If the client has the server grabbed, an UngrabServer isperformed. All selections (see SetSelectionOwner request)owned by the client are disowned. If close-down mode (seeSetCloseDownMode request) is RetainPermanent orRetainTemporary, then all resources (including colormapentries) allocated by the client are marked as permanent ortemporary, respectively (but this does not prevent otherclients from explicitly destroying them). If the mode isDestroy, all of the client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed.When a client&rsquo;s resources are destroyed, for each window inthe client&rsquo;s save-set, if the window is an inferior of awindow created by the client, the save-set window isreparented to the closest ancestor such that the save-setwindow is not an inferior of a window created by the client.If the save-set window is unmapped, a MapWindow request isperformed on it (even if it was not an inferior of a windowcreated by the client). The reparenting leaves unchangedthe absolute coordinates (with respect to the root window)of the upper-left outer corner of the save-set window.After save-set processing, all windows created by the clientare destroyed. For each nonwindow resource created by theclient, the appropriate Free request is performed. Allcolors and colormap entries allocated by the client arefreed.A server goes through a cycle of having no connections andhaving some connections. At every transition to the stateof having no connections as a result of a connection closingwith a Destroy close-down mode, the server resets its stateas if it had just been started. This starts by destroyingall lingering resources from clients that have terminated inRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary mode. It additionallyincludes deleting all but the predefined atom identifiers,deleting all properties on all root windows, resetting alldevice maps and attributes (key click, bell volume,acceleration), resetting the access control list, restoringthe standard root tiles and cursors, restoring the defaultfont path, and restoring the input focus to statePointerRoot.Note that closing a connection with a close-down mode ofRetainPermanent or RetainTemporary will not cause the serverto reset.11. EventsWhen a button press is processed with the pointer in somewindow W and no active pointer grab is in progress, theancestors of W are searched from the root down, looking fora passive grab to activate. If no matching passive grab onthe button exists, then an active grab is startedautomatically for the client receiving the event, and thelast-pointer-grab time is set to the current server time.The effect is essentially equivalent to a GrabButton witharguments:The grab is terminated automatically when the logical stateof the pointer has all buttons released. UngrabPointer andChangeActivePointerGrab can both be used to modify theactive grab.__&#9474; KeyPressKeyReleaseButtonPressButtonReleaseMotionNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16detail: &lt;see below&gt;state: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ These events are generated either when a key or buttonlogically changes state or when the pointer logically moves.The generation of these logical changes may lag the physicalchanges if device event processing is frozen. Note thatKeyPress and KeyRelease are generated for all keys, eventhose mapped to modifier bits. The source of the event isthe window the pointer is in. The window the event isreported with respect to is called the event window. Theevent window is found by starting with the source window andlooking up the hierarchy for the first window on which anyclient has selected interest in the event (provided nointervening window prohibits event generation by includingthe event type in its do-not-propagate-mask). The actualwindow used for reporting can be modified by active grabsand, in the case of keyboard events, can be modified by thefocus window.The root is the root window of the source window, and root-xand root-y are the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;sorigin at the time of the event. Event is the event window.If the event window is on the same screen as root, thenevent-x and event-y are the pointer coordinates relative tothe event window&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-yare zero. If the source window is an inferior of the eventwindow, then child is set to the child of the event windowthat is an ancestor of (or is) the source window.Otherwise, it is set to None. The state component gives thelogical state of the buttons and modifier keys just beforethe event. The detail component type varies with the eventtype:MotionNotify events are only generated when the motionbegins and ends in the window. The granularity of motionevents is not guaranteed, but a client selecting for motionevents is guaranteed to get at least one event when thepointer moves and comes to rest. Selecting PointerMotionreceives events independent of the state of the pointerbuttons. By selecting some subset of Button[1-5]Motioninstead, MotionNotify events will only be received when oneor more of the specified buttons are pressed. By selectingButtonMotion, MotionNotify events will be received only whenat least one button is pressed. The events are always oftype MotionNotify, independent of the selection. IfPointerMotionHint is selected, the server is free to sendonly one MotionNotify event (with detail Hint) to the clientfor the event window until either the key or button statechanges, the pointer leaves the event window, or the clientissues a QueryPointer or GetMotionEvents request.__&#9474; EnterNotifyLeaveNotifyroot, event: WINDOWchild: WINDOW or Nonesame-screen: BOOLroot-x, root-y, event-x, event-y: INT16mode: {Normal, Grab, Ungrab}detail: {Ancestor, Virtual, Inferior, Nonlinear,NonlinearVirtual}focus: BOOLstate: SETofKEYBUTMASKtime: TIMESTAMP&#9474;__ If pointer motion or window hierarchy change causes thepointer to be in a different window than before, EnterNotifyand LeaveNotify events are generated instead of aMotionNotify event. Only clients selecting EnterWindow on awindow receive EnterNotify events, and only clientsselecting LeaveWindow receive LeaveNotify events. Thepointer position reported in the event is always the finalposition, not the initial position of the pointer. The rootis the root window for this position, and root-x and root-yare the pointer coordinates relative to root&rsquo;s origin at thetime of the event. Event is the event window. If the eventwindow is on the same screen as root, then event-x andevent-y are the pointer coordinates relative to the eventwindow&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, event-x and event-y are zero.In a LeaveNotify event, if a child of the event windowcontains the initial position of the pointer, then the childcomponent is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None. Foran EnterNotify event, if a child of the event windowcontains the final pointer position, then the childcomponent is set to that child. Otherwise, it is None. Ifthe event window is the focus window or an inferior of thefocus window, then focus is True. Otherwise, focus isFalse.Normal pointer motion events have mode Normal.Pseudo-motion events when a grab activates have mode Grab,and pseudo-motion events when a grab deactivates have modeUngrab.All EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events caused by a hierarchychange are generated after any hierarchy event caused bythat change (that is, UnmapNotify, MapNotify,ConfigureNotify, GravityNotify, CirculateNotify), but theordering of EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events with respectto FocusOut, VisibilityNotify, and Expose events is notconstrained.Normal events are generated as follows:When the pointer moves from window A to window B and A is aninferior of B:&bull; LeaveNotify with detail Ancestor is generated on A.&bull; LeaveNotify with detail Virtual is generated on eachwindow between A and B exclusive (in that order).&bull; EnterNotify with detail Inferior is generated on B.When the pointer moves from window A to window B and B is aninferior of A:&bull; LeaveNotify with detail Inferior is generated on A.&bull; EnterNotify with detail Virtual is generated on eachwindow between A and B exclusive (in that order).&bull; EnterNotify with detail Ancestor is generated on B.When the pointer moves from window A to window B and windowC is their least common ancestor:&bull; LeaveNotify with detail Nonlinear is generated on A.&bull; LeaveNotify with detail NonlinearVirtual is generatedon each window between A and C exclusive (in thatorder).&bull; EnterNotify with detail NonlinearVirtual is generatedon each window between C and B exclusive (in thatorder).&bull; EnterNotify with detail Nonlinear is generated on B.When the pointer moves from window A to window B ondifferent screens:&bull; LeaveNotify with detail Nonlinear is generated on A.&bull; If A is not a root window, LeaveNotify with detailNonlinearVirtual is generated on each window above A upto and including its root (in order).&bull; If B is not a root window, EnterNotify with detailNonlinearVirtual is generated on each window from B&rsquo;sroot down to but not including B (in order).&bull; EnterNotify with detail Nonlinear is generated on B.When a pointer grab activates (but after any initial warpinto a confine-to window and before generating any actualButtonPress event that activates the grab), G is thegrab-window for the grab, and P is the window the pointer isin:&bull; EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events with mode Grab aregenerated (as for Normal above) as if the pointer wereto suddenly warp from its current position in P to someposition in G.

The format specifies whether the datashould be viewed as a list of 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bitquantities, so that the server can correctly byte-swap, asnecessary. The data always consists of either 20 8-bitvalues or 10 16-bit values or 5 32-bit values, althoughparticular message types might not make use of all of thesevalues.12. Flow Control and ConcurrencyWhenever the server is writing to a given connection, it ispermissible for the server to stop reading from thatconnection (but if the writing would block, it must continueto service other connections). The server is not requiredto buffer more than a single request per connection at onetime. For a given connection to the server, a client canblock while reading from the connection but should undertaketo read (events and errors) when writing would block.Failure on the part of a client to obey this rule couldresult in a deadlocked connection, although deadlock isprobably unlikely unless either the transport layer has verylittle buffering or the client attempts to send largenumbers of requests without ever reading replies or checkingfor errors and events.Whether or not a server is implemented with internalconcurrency, the overall effect must be as if individualrequests are executed to completion in some serial order,and requests from a given connection must be executed indelivery order (that is, the total execution order is ashuffle of the individual streams). The execution of arequest includes validating all arguments, collecting alldata for any reply, and generating and queueing all requiredevents. However, it does not include the actualtransmission of the reply and the events. In addition, theeffect of any other cause that can generate multiple events(for example, activation of a grab or pointer motion) musteffectively generate and queue all required eventsindivisibly with respect to all other causes and requests.For a request from a given client, any events destined forthat client that are caused by executing the request must besent to the client before any reply or error is sent.1</h2>

</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">There are two
special KEYSYM values: <i>NoSymbol</i> and
<i>VoidSymbol</i>. They are used to indicate the absence of
symbols (see section 5).</p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><img src="proto30.png" alt="Image proto30.png"></p>

<p valign="top">All other standard KEYSYM values have zero
values for bytes 1 and 2. Byte 3 indicates a character code
set, and byte 4 indicates a particular character within that
set.</p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><img src="proto31.png" alt="Image proto31.png"></p>

<p valign="top">Each character set contains gaps where
codes have been removed that were duplicates with codes in
previous character sets (that is, character sets with lesser
byte 3 value).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The 94 and 96
character code sets have been moved to occupy the right-hand
quadrant (decimal 129 through 256), so the ASCII subset has
a unique encoding across byte 4, which corresponds to the
ASCII character code. However, this cannot be guaranteed
with future registrations and does not apply to all of the
Keyboard set.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To the best of our
knowledge, the Latin, Kana, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, APL,
and Hebrew sets are from the appropriate ISO and/or ECMA
international standards. There are no Technical, Special, or
Publishing international standards, so these sets are based
on Digital Equipment Corporation standards.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The ordering
between the sets (byte 3) is essentially arbitrary. National
and international standards bodies were commencing
deliberations regarding international 2-byte and 4-byte
character sets at the time these keysyms were developed, but
we did not know of any proposed layouts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The order may be
arbitrary, but it is important in dealing with duplicate
coding. As far as possible, keysym values (byte 4) follow
the character set encoding standards, except for the Greek
and Cyrillic keysyms which are based on early draft
standards. In the Latin-1 to Latin-4 sets, all duplicate
glyphs occupy the same code position. However, duplicates
between Greek and Technical do not occupy the same code
position. Applications that wish to use the Latin-2,
Latin-3, Latin-4, Greek, Cyrillic, or Technical sets may
find it convenient to use arrays to transform the
keysyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">There is a
difference between European and US usage of the names
Pilcrow, Paragraph, and Section, as follows:</p>


<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><img src="proto32.png" alt="Image proto32.png"></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">We have adopted the
US names (by accident rather than by design).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The Keyboard set is
a miscellaneous collection of commonly occurring keys on
keyboards. Within this set, the keypad symbols are generally
duplicates of symbols found on keys on the main part of the
keyboard, but they are distinguished here because they often
have a distinguishable semantics associated with them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Keyboards tend to
be comparatively standard with respect to the alphanumeric
keys, but they differ radically on the miscellaneous
function keys. Many function keys are left over from early
timesharing days or are designed for a specific application.
Keyboard layouts from large manufacturers tend to have lots
of keys for every conceivable purpose, whereas small
workstation manufacturers often add keys that are solely for
support of some of their unique functionality. There are two
ways of thinking about how to define keysyms for such a
world:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The Common
approach</p> </td>
<td width="46%">
</td>
</table>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The Engraving
approach is to create a keysym for every unique key
engraving. This is effectively taking the union of all key
engravings on all keyboards. For example, some keyboards
label function keys across the top as F1 through Fn, and
others label them as PF1 through PFn. These would be
different keys under the Engraving approach. Likewise, Lock
would differ from Shift Lock, which is different from the
up-arrow symbol that has the effect of changing lowercase to
uppercase. There are lots of other aliases such as Del, DEL,
Delete, Remove, and so forth. The Engraving approach makes
it easy to decide if a new entry should be added to the
keysym set: if it does not exactly match an existing one,
then a new one is created. One estimate is that there would
be on the order of 300&minus;500 Keyboard keysyms using this
approach, without counting foreign translations and
variations.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The Common approach
tries to capture all of the keys present on an interesting
number of keyboards, folding likely aliases into the same
keysym. For example, Del, DEL, and Delete are all merged
into a single keysym. Vendors would be expected to augment
the keysym set (using the vendor-specific encoding space) to
include all of their unique keys that were not included in
the standard set. Each vendor decides which of its keys map
into the standard keysyms, which presumably can be
overridden by a user. It is more difficult to implement this
approach, because judgment is required about when a
sufficient set of keyboards implements an engraving to
justify making it a keysym in the standard set and about
which engravings should be merged into a single keysym.
Under this scheme there are an estimated 100&minus;150
keysyms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Although neither
scheme is perfect or elegant, the Common approach has been
selected because it makes it easier to write a portable
application. Having the Delete functionality merged into a
single keysym allows an application to implement a deletion
function and expect reasonable bindings on a wide set of
workstations. Under the Common approach, application writers
are still free to look for and interpret vendor-specific
keysyms, but because they are in the extended set, the
application developer is more conscious that they are
writing the application in a nonportable fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">In the listings
below, Code Pos is a representation of byte 4 of the KEYSYM
value, expressed as most-significant/least-significant 4-bit
values. The Code Pos numbers are for reference only and do
not affect the KEYSYM value. In all cases, the KEYSYM value
is:</p>

The most-significant bit in a BITMASK is reserved for use in

existing core requests. The precise interpretation of this
bit is not yet defined here, although a probable mechanism
is that a 1-bit indicates that another N bytes of bitmask
follows, with bits within the overall mask still interpreted

with the overall mask being byte-swapped in individual

<p align=center style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b><big>Glossary</big>
Access control list</b></p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">X maintains a list
of hosts from which client programs can be run. By default,
only programs on the local host and hosts specified in an
initial list read by the server can use the display. Clients
on the local host can change this access control list. Some
server implementations can also implement other
authorization mechanisms in addition to or in place of this
mechanism. The action of this mechanism can be conditional
based on the authorization protocol name and data received
by the server at connection setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Active
grab</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A grab is
active when the pointer or keyboard is actually owned by the
single grabbing client.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Ancestors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">If W is an
inferior of A, then A is an ancestor of W.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Atom</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An atom is a
unique ID corresponding to a string name. Atoms are used to
identify properties, types, and selections.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Background</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>InputOutput</i> window can have a background, which is
defined as a pixmap. When regions of the window have their
contents lost or invalidated, the server will automatically
tile those regions with the background.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Backing
store</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">When a server
maintains the contents of a window, the pixels saved off
screen are known as a backing store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Bit
gravity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">When a window
is resized, the contents of the window are not necessarily
discarded. It is possible to request that the server
relocate the previous contents to some region of the window
(though no guarantees are made). This attraction of window
contents for some location of a window is known as bit
gravity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Bit
plane</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">When a pixmap
or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps, each bitmap
is called a bit plane or plane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Bitmap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A bitmap is a
pixmap of depth one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Border</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>InputOutput</i> window can have a border of equal
thickness on all four sides of the window. A pixmap defines
the contents of the border, and the server automatically
maintains the contents of the border. Exposure events are
never generated for border regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Button
grabbing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Buttons on the
pointer may be passively grabbed by a client. When the
button is pressed, the pointer is then actively grabbed by
the client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Byte
order</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">For image
(pixmap/bitmap) data, the server defines the byte order, and
clients with different native byte ordering must swap bytes
as necessary. For all other parts of the protocol, the
client defines the byte order, and the server swaps bytes as
necessary.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Children</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The children of
a window are its first-level subwindows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Client</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An application
program connects to the window system server by some
interprocess communication path, such as a TCP connection or
a shared memory buffer. This program is referred to as a
client of the window system server. More precisely, the
client is the communication path itself; a program with
multiple paths open to the server is viewed as multiple
clients by the protocol. Resource lifetimes are controlled
by connection lifetimes, not by program lifetimes.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Clipping
region</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">In a graphics
context, a bitmap or list of rectangles can be specified to
restrict output to a particular region of the window. The
image defined by the bitmap or rectangles is called a
clipping region.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Colormap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A colormap
consists of a set of entries defining color values. The
colormap associated with a window is used to display the
contents of the window; each pixel value indexes the
colormap to produce RGB values that drive the guns of a
monitor. Depending on hardware limitations, one or more
colormaps may be installed at one time, so that windows
associated with those maps display with correct colors.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Connection</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The
interprocess communication path between the server and
client program is known as a connection. A client program
typically (but not necessarily) has one connection to the
server over which requests and events are sent.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Containment</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A window
&lsquo;&lsquo;contains&rsquo;&rsquo; the pointer if the
window is viewable and the hotspot of the cursor is within a
visible region of the window or a visible region of one of
its inferiors. The border of the window is included as part
of the window for containment. The pointer is
&lsquo;&lsquo;in&rsquo;&rsquo; a window if the window
contains the pointer but no inferior contains the
pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Coordinate
system</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The coordinate
system has the X axis horizontal and the Y axis vertical,
with the origin [0, 0] at the upper left. Coordinates are
integral, in terms of pixels, and coincide with pixel
centers. Each window and pixmap has its own coordinate
system. For a window, the origin is inside the border at the
inside upper left.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Cursor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A cursor is the
visible shape of the pointer on a screen. It consists of a
hot spot, a source bitmap, a shape bitmap, and a pair of
colors. The cursor defined for a window controls the visible
appearance when the pointer is in that window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Depth</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The depth of a
window or pixmap is the number of bits per pixel that it
has. The depth of a graphics context is the depth of the
drawables it can be used in conjunction with for graphics
output.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Device</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Keyboards,
mice, tablets, track-balls, button boxes, and so on are all
collectively known as input devices. The core protocol only
deals with two devices, &lsquo;&lsquo;the
keyboard&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;the
pointer.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>DirectColor</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DirectColor</i>
is a class of colormap in which a pixel value is decomposed
into three separate subfields for indexing. The first
subfield indexes an array to produce red intensity values.
The second subfield indexes a second array to produce blue
intensity values. The third subfield indexes a third array
to produce green intensity values. The RGB values can be
changed dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Display</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A server,
together with its screens and input devices, is called a
display.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Drawable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Both windows
and pixmaps can be used as sources and destinations in
graphics operations. These windows and pixmaps are
collectively known as drawables. However, an
<i>InputOnly</i> window cannot be used as a source or
destination in a graphics operation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Event</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Clients are
informed of information asynchronously by means of events.
These events can be generated either asynchronously from
devices or as side effects of client requests. Events are
grouped into types. The server never sends events to a
client unless the client has specificially asked to be
informed of that type of event. However, other clients can
force events to be sent to other clients. Events are
typically reported relative to a window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Event
mask</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Events are
requested relative to a window. The set of event types that
a client requests relative to a window is described by using
an event mask.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Event
synchronization</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">There are
certain race conditions possible when demultiplexing device
events to clients (in particular deciding where pointer and
keyboard events should be sent when in the middle of window
management operations). The event synchronization mechanism
allows synchronous processing of device events.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Event
propagation</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Device-related
events propagate from the source window to ancestor windows
until some client has expressed interest in handling that
type of event or until the event is discarded
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Event
source</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The window the
pointer is in is the source of a device-related event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Exposure
event</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Servers do not
guarantee to preserve the contents of windows when windows
are obscured or reconfigured. Exposure events are sent to
clients to inform them when contents of regions of windows
have been lost.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Extension</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Named
extensions to the core protocol can be defined to extend the
system. Extension to output requests, resources, and event
types are all possible and are expected.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Focus
window</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The focus
window is another term for the input focus.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Font</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A font is a
matrix of glyphs (typically characters). The protocol does
no translation or interpretation of character sets. The
client simply indicates values used to index the glyph
array. A font contains additional metric information to
determine interglyph and interline spacing.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>GC</b>,
<b>GContext</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">GC and gcontext
are abbreviations for graphics context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Glyph</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A glyph is an
image, typically of a character, in a font.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Grab</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Keyboard keys,
the keyboard, pointer buttons, the pointer, and the server
can be grabbed for exclusive use by a client. In general,
these facilities are not intended to be used by normal
applications but are intended for various input and window
managers to implement various styles of user interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Graphics
context</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Various
information for graphics output is stored in a graphics
context such as foreground pixel, background pixel, line
width, clipping region, and so on. A graphics context can
only be used with drawables that have the same root and the
same depth as the graphics context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Gravity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">See <b>bit
gravity</b> and <b>window gravity</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>GrayScale</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em"><i>GrayScale</i>
can be viewed as a degenerate case of <i>PseudoColor</i>, in
which the red, green, and blue values in any given colormap
entry are equal, thus producing shades of gray. The gray
values can be changed dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Hotspot</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A cursor has an
associated hotspot that defines the point in the cursor
corresponding to the coordinates reported for the
pointer.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Identifier</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An identifier
is a unique value associated with a resource that clients
use to name that resource. The identifier can be used over
any connection.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Inferiors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The inferiors
of a window are all of the subwindows nested below it: the
children, the children&rsquo;s children, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Input
focus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The input focus
is normally a window defining the scope for processing of
keyboard input. If a generated keyboard event would normally
be reported to this window or one of its inferiors, the
event is reported normally. Otherwise, the event is reported
with respect to the focus window. The input focus also can
be set such that all keyboard events are discarded and such
that the focus window is dynamically taken to be the root
window of whatever screen the pointer is on at each keyboard
event.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Input
manager</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Control over
keyboard input is typically provided by an input manager
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>InputOnly
window</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>InputOnly</i> window is a window that cannot be used for
graphics requests. <i>InputOnly</i> windows are invisible
and can be used to control such things as cursors, input
event generation, and grabbing. <i>InputOnly</i> windows
cannot have <i>InputOutput</i> windows as inferiors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>InputOutput
window</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>InputOutput</i> window is the normal kind of opaque
window, used for both input and output. <i>InputOutput</i>
windows can have both <i>InputOutput</i> and
<i>InputOnly</i> windows as inferiors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Key
grabbing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Keys on the
keyboard can be passively grabbed by a client. When the key
is pressed, the keyboard is then actively grabbed by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Keyboard
grabbing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A client can
actively grab control of the keyboard, and key events will
be sent to that client rather than the client the events
would normally have been sent to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Keysym</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An encoding of
a symbol on a keycap on a keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Mapped</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A window is
said to be mapped if a map call has been performed on it.
Unmapped windows and their inferiors are never viewable or
visible.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Modifier
keys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Shift, Control,
Meta, Super, Hyper, Alt, Compose, Apple, CapsLock,
ShiftLock, and similar keys are called modifier keys.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Monochrome</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Monochrome is a
special case of <i>StaticGray</i> in which there are only
two colormap entries.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Obscure</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A window is
obscured if some other window obscures it. Window A obscures
window B if both are viewable <i>InputOutput</i> windows, A
is higher in the global stacking order, and the rectangle
defined by the outside edges of A intersects the rectangle
defined by the outside edges of B. Note the distinction
between obscure and occludes. Also note that window borders
are included in the calculation and that a window can be
obscured and yet still have visible regions.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Occlude</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A window is
occluded if some other window occludes it. Window A occludes
window B if both are mapped, A is higher in the global
stacking order, and the rectangle defined by the outside
edges of A intersects the rectangle defined by the outside
edges of B. Note the distinction between occludes and
obscures. Also note that window borders are included in the
calculation.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Padding</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Some padding
bytes are inserted in the data stream to maintain alignment
of the protocol requests on natural boundaries. This
increases ease of portability to some machine
architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Parent
window</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">If C is a child
of P, then P is the parent of C.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Passive
grab</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Grabbing a key
or button is a passive grab. The grab activates when the key
or button is actually pressed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Pixel
value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A pixel is an
N-bit value, where N is the number of bit planes used in a
particular window or pixmap (that is, N is the depth of the
window or pixmap). For a window, a pixel value indexes a
colormap to derive an actual color to be displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Pixmap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A pixmap is a
three-dimensional array of bits. A pixmap is normally
thought of as a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each
pixel can be a value from 0 to (2^N)-1 and where N is the
depth (z axis) of the pixmap. A pixmap can also be thought
of as a stack of N bitmaps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Plane</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">When a pixmap
or window is thought of as a stack of bitmaps, each bitmap
is called a plane or bit plane.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Plane
mask</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Graphics
operations can be restricted to only affect a subset of bit
planes of a destination. A plane mask is a bit mask
describing which planes are to be modified. The plane mask
is stored in a graphics context.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Pointer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The pointer is
the pointing device attached to the cursor and tracked on
the screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Pointer
grabbing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A client can
actively grab control of the pointer. Then button and motion
events will be sent to that client rather than the client
the events would normally have been sent to.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Pointing
device</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A pointing
device is typically a mouse, tablet, or some other device
with effective dimensional motion. There is only one visible
cursor defined by the core protocol, and it tracks whatever
pointing device is attached as the pointer.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Property</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Windows may
have associated properties, which consist of a name, a type,
a data format, and some data. The protocol places no
interpretation on properties. They are intended as a
general-purpose naming mechanism for clients. For example,
clients might use properties to share information such as
resize hints, program names, and icon formats with a window
manager.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Property
list</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The property
list of a window is the list of properties that have been
defined for the window.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>PseudoColor</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em"><i>PseudoColor</i>
is a class of colormap in which a pixel value indexes the
colormap to produce independent red, green, and blue values;
that is, the colormap is viewed as an array of triples (RGB
values). The RGB values can be changed dynamically.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Redirecting
control</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Window managers
(or client programs) may want to enforce window layout
policy in various ways. When a client attempts to change the
size or position of a window, the operation may be
redirected to a specified client rather than the operation
actually being performed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Reply</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Information
requested by a client program is sent back to the client
with a reply. Both events and replies are multiplexed on the
same connection. Most requests do not generate replies,
although some requests generate multiple replies.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Request</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A command to
the server is called a request. It is a single block of data
sent over a connection.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Resource</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Windows,
pixmaps, cursors, fonts, graphics contexts, and colormaps
are known as resources. They all have unique identifiers
associated with them for naming purposes. The lifetime of a
resource usually is bounded by the lifetime of the
connection over which the resource was created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>RGB
values</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Red, green, and
blue (RGB) intensity values are used to define color. These
values are always represented as 16-bit unsigned numbers,
with 0 being the minimum intensity and 65535 being the
maximum intensity. The server scales the values to match the
display hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Root</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The root of a
pixmap, colormap, or graphics context is the same as the
root of whatever drawable was used when the pixmap,
colormap, or graphics context was created. The root of a
window is the root window under which the window was
created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Root
window</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Each screen has
a root window covering it. It cannot be reconfigured or
unmapped, but it otherwise acts as a full-fledged window. A
root window has no parent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Save set</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The save set of
a client is a list of other clients&rsquo; windows that, if
they are inferiors of one of the client&rsquo;s windows at
connection close, should not be destroyed and that should be
remapped if currently unmapped. Save sets are typically used
by window managers to avoid lost windows if the manager
terminates abnormally.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Scanline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A scanline is a
list of pixel or bit values viewed as a horizontal row (all
values having the same y coordinate) of an image, with the
values ordered by increasing x coordinate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Scanline
order</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">An image
represented in scanline order contains scanlines ordered by
increasing y coordinate.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Screen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A server can
provide several independent screens, which typically have
physically independent monitors. This would be the expected
configuration when there is only a single keyboard and
pointer shared among the screens.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Selection</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A selection can
be thought of as an indirect property with dynamic type;
that is, rather than having the property stored in the
server, it is maintained by some client (the
&lsquo;&lsquo;owner&rsquo;&rsquo;). A selection is global in
nature and is thought of as belonging to the user (although
maintained by clients), rather than as being private to a
particular window subhierarchy or a particular set of
clients. When a client asks for the contents of a selection,
it specifies a selection &lsquo;&lsquo;target
type&rsquo;&rsquo;. This target type can be used to control
the transmitted representation of the contents. For example,
if the selection is &lsquo;&lsquo;the last thing the user
clicked on&rsquo;&rsquo; and that is currently an image,
then the target type might specify whether the contents of
the image should be sent in XY format or Z format. The
target type can also be used to control the class of
contents transmitted; for example, asking for the
&lsquo;&lsquo;looks&rsquo;&rsquo; (fonts, line spacing,
indentation, and so on) of a paragraph selection rather than
the text of the paragraph. The target type can also be used
for other purposes. The protocol does not constrain the
semantics.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Server</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The server
provides the basic windowing mechanism. It handles
connections from clients, multiplexes graphics requests onto
the screens, and demultiplexes input back to the appropriate
clients.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Server
grabbing</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The server can
be grabbed by a single client for exclusive use. This
prevents processing of any requests from other client
connections until the grab is completed. This is typically
only a transient state for such things as rubber-banding,
pop-up menus, or to execute requests indivisibly.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Sibling</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Children of the
same parent window are known as sibling windows.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Stacking
order</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Sibling windows
may stack on top of each other. Windows above other windows
both obscure and occlude those lower windows. This is
similar to paper on a desk. The relationship between sibling
windows is known as the stacking order.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>StaticColor</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em"><i>StaticColor</i>
can be viewed as a degenerate case of <i>PseudoColor</i> in
which the RGB values are predefined and read-only.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>StaticGray</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em"><i>StaticGray</i>
can be viewed as a degenerate case of <i>GrayScale</i> in
which the gray values are predefined and read-only. The
values are typically linear or near-linear increasing
ramps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Stipple</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A stipple
pattern is a bitmap that is used to tile a region that will
serve as an additional clip mask for a fill operation with
the foreground color.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>String
Equivalence</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Two ISO Latin-1
STRING8 values are considered equal if they are the same
length and if corresponding bytes are either equal or are
equivalent as follows: decimal values 65 to 90 inclusive
(characters &lsquo;&lsquo;A&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;Z&rsquo;&rsquo;) are pairwise equivalent to
decimal values 97 to 122 inclusive (characters
&lsquo;&lsquo;a&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;z&rsquo;&rsquo;), decimal values 192 to 214
inclusive (characters &lsquo;&lsquo;A grave&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;O diaeresis&rsquo;&rsquo;) are pairwise
equivalent to decimal values 224 to 246 inclusive
(characters &lsquo;&lsquo;a grave&rsquo;&rsquo; to
&lsquo;&lsquo;o diaeresis&rsquo;&rsquo;), and decimal values
216 to 222 inclusive (characters &lsquo;&lsquo;O
oblique&rsquo;&rsquo; to &lsquo;&lsquo;THORN&rsquo;&rsquo;)
are pairwise equivalent to decimal values 246 to 254
inclusive (characters &lsquo;&lsquo;o oblique&rsquo;&rsquo;
to &lsquo;&lsquo;thorn&rsquo;&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Tile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A pixmap can be
replicated in two dimensions to tile a region. The pixmap
itself is also known as a tile.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Timestamp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A timestamp is
a time value, expressed in milliseconds. It typically is the
time since the last server reset. Timestamp values wrap
around (after about 49.7 days). The server, given its
current time is represented by timestamp T, always
interprets timestamps from clients by treating half of the
timestamp space as being earlier in time than T and half of
the timestamp space as being later in time than T. One
timestamp value (named <i>CurrentTime</i>) is never
generated by the server. This value is reserved for use in
requests to represent the current server time.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>TrueColor</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em"><i>TrueColor</i>
can be viewed as a degenerate case of <i>DirectColor</i> in
which the subfields in the pixel value directly encode the
corresponding RGB values; that is, the colormap has
predefined read-only RGB values. The values are typically
linear or near-linear increasing ramps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Type</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A type is an
arbitrary atom used to identify the interpretation of
property data. Types are completely uninterpreted by the
server and are solely for the benefit of clients.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Viewable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A window is
viewable if it and all of its ancestors are mapped. This
does not imply that any portion of the window is actually
visible. Graphics requests can be performed on a window when
it is not viewable, but output will not be retained unless
the server is maintaining backing store.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Visible</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">A region of a
window is visible if someone looking at the screen can
actually see it; that is, the window is viewable and the
region is not occluded by any other window.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Window
gravity</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">When windows
are resized, subwindows may be repositioned automatically
relative to some position in the window. This attraction of
a subwindow to some part of its parent is known as window
gravity.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>Window
manager</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">Manipulation of
windows on the screen and much of the user interface
(policy) is typically provided by a window manager
client.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>XYFormat</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The data for a
pixmap is said to be in XY format if it is organized as a
set of bitmaps representing individual bit planes, with the
planes appearing from most-significant to least-significant
in bit order.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>ZFormat</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-top: 1em">The data for a
pixmap is said to be in Z format if it is organized as a set
of pixel values in scanline order.</p>
