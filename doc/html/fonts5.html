<H3><A NAME="43"></A>5.1. Characters and glyphs </H3>
<p>A computer text-processing system inputs keystrokes and outputs
<i>glyphs</i>, small pictures that are assembled on paper or on a
computer screen.  Keystrokes and glyphs do not, in general, coincide:
for example, if the system does generate ligatures, then to the
sequence of two keystrokes &lt;<code>f</code>&gt;&lt;<code>i</code>&gt; will typically
correspond a single glyph.  Similarly, if the system shapes Arabic
glyphs in a vaguely reasonable manner, then multiple different glyphs
may correspond to a single keystroke.</p>
<p>The complex transformation rules from keystrokes to glyphs are usually
factored into two simpler transformations, from keystrokes to
<i>characters</i> and from characters to glyphs.  You may want to think
of characters as the basic unit of text that is stored <i>e.g.</i> in
the buffer of your text editor.  While the definition of a character
is intrinsically application-specific, a number of standardised
collections of characters have been defined.</p>
<p>A <i>coded character set</i> is a set of characters together with a
mapping from integer codes --- known as <i>codepoints</i> --- to
characters.  Examples of coded character sets include US-ASCII,
ISO&nbsp;8859-1, KOI8-R, and JIS&nbsp;X&nbsp;0208(1990).</p>
<p>A coded character set need not use 8 bit integers to index characters.
Many early systems used 6 bit character sets, while 16 bit (or more)
character sets are necessary for ideographic writing systems.</p>

<H3><A NAME="44"></A>5.2. Font files, fonts, and XLFD <A NAME="sec:xlfd"></A> 
</H3>
<p>Traditionally, typographers speak about <i>typefaces</i> and
<i>founts</i>.  A typeface is a particular style or design, such as
Times Italic, while a fount is a molten-lead incarnation of a given
typeface at a given size.</p>
<p>Digital fonts come in <i>font files</i>.  A font file contains the
information necessary for generating glyphs of a given typeface, and
applications using font files may access glyph information in an
arbitrary order.</p>
<p>Digital fonts may consist of bitmap data, in which case they are said
to be <i>bitmap fonts</i>.  They may also consist of a mathematical
description of glyph shapes, in which case they are said to be
<i>scalable fonts</i>.  Common formats for scalable font files are
<i>Type&nbsp;1</i> (sometimes incorrectly called <i>ATM fonts</i> or
<i>PostScript fonts</i>), <i>TrueType</i> and <i>Speedo</i>.</p>
<p>The glyph data in a digital font needs to be indexed somehow.  How
this is done depends on the font file format.  In the case of
Type&nbsp;1 fonts, glyphs are identified by <i>glyph names</i>.  In the
case of TrueType fonts, glyphs are indexed by integers corresponding
to one of a number of indexing schemes (usually Unicode --- see below).</p>
<p>The X11 core fonts system uses the data in a font file to generate
<i>font instances</i>, which are collections of glyphs at a given size
indexed according to a given encoding.</p>
<p>X11 core font instances are usually specified using a notation known
as the <i>X Logical Font Description</i> (XLFD).  An XLFD starts with a
dash `<code>-</code>', and consists of fourteen fields separated by dashes,
for example:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1
</pre>
</code></blockquote>

Or particular interest are the last two fields `<code>iso8859-1</code>', which
specify the font instance's encoding.</p>
<p>A scalable font is specified by an XLFD which contains zeroes instead
of some fields:
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-m-0-iso8859-1
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>
<p>X11 font instances may also be specified by short name.  Unlike an
XLFD, a short name has no structure and is simply a conventional name
for a font instance.  Two short names are of particular interest, as
the server will not start if font instances with these names cannot be
opened.  These are `<code>fixed</code>', which specifies the fallback font to
use when the requested font cannot be opened, and `<code>cursor</code>', which
specifies the set of glyphs to be used by the mouse pointer.</p>
<p>Short names are usually implemented as aliases to XLFDs; the
standard `<code>fixed</code>' and `<code>cursor</code>' aliases are defined in
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/font/misc/fonts.alias
</pre>
</code></blockquote>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="45"></A>5.3. Unicode </H3>
<p>Unicode (<A href="http://www.unicode.org">http://www.unicode.org</A>) is a coded character
set with the goal of uniquely identifying all characters for all
scripts, current and historical.  While Unicode was explicitly not
designed as a glyph encoding scheme, it is often possible to use it as
such.</p>
<p>Unicode is an <i>open</i> character set, meaning that codepoint
assignments may be added to Unicode at any time (once specified,
though, an assignment can never be changed).  For this reason, a
Unicode font will be <i>sparse</i>, meaning that it only defines glyphs
for a subset of the character registry of Unicode.</p>
<p>The Unicode standard is defined in parallel with the international
standard ISO&nbsp;10646.  Assignments in the two standards are always
equivalent, and we often use the terms <i>Unicode</i> and
<i>ISO&nbsp;10646</i> interchangeably.</p>
<p>When used in the X11 core fonts system, Unicode-encoded fonts should
have the last two fields of their XLFD set to `<code>iso10646-1</code>'.</p>
