<HR NOSHADE>
  <H2><A NAME="2"></A>2. The DPS client side </H2>
<p>The DPS client side consists of four libraries and a number of
basic tools for programming and configuration; these are all included
with XFree86.</p>

<H3><A NAME="3"></A>2.1. Libraries </H3>
<p>The <code>libpsres</code> library is a library for management of
<i>PostScript resources</i>, on-disk files representing PostScript data
structures such as fonts, font encodings, procsets, <i>etc.</i> It is
closely related to the <code>makepsres</code> tool (see 
<A HREF="dps2.html#sec:tools">client-side tools</A> later in this document).</p>
<p>The basic DPS client library is <code>libdps</code>.  This library contains a
number of functions for connection establishment, resource management,
as well as stubs for all standard PostScript operators.  Normally, all
DPS clients should link with <code>libdps</code>; in addition, <code>libdps</code> may
be used for printing by non-DPS clients (this is done, for example, by
Sun's JDK).  This library is documented in [CLRM] and [CLSX].</p>
<p>The <code>libdpstk</code> library contains a number of additional utilities
for managing DPS contexts, user paths and user objects, and for
previewing EPS files.  It is documented in [DPTX].</p>
<p>The <code>libdpstkXm</code> library contains four Motif widgets.  The <i>DPS
Scrolling Widget</i> is a DPS drawing area that automatically manages
issues such as scrolling, scaling, client-side backing store,
incremental redisplay, <i>etc.</i> The <i>Font Selection Box</i>, and its
associated <i>Font Preview</i>, present a convenient and powerful
interface for choosing scalable fonts.  Finally, the <i>Color Picker</i>
presents an interface for choosing colours using either of the RGB or
HSV spaces.  The latter three widgets are documented in [DPTX]; some
summary Scrolling Widget documentation is available in the <code>doc</code>
subdirectory of the <code>DPS.tar.gz</code> file, available from <A href="ftp://dps.sourceforge.net/pub/dps/DPS.tar.gz">ftp://dps.sourceforge.net/pub/dps/DPS.tar.gz</A>.</p>
<p>The source code for <code>libdpstkXm</code> is included with XFree86; however,
as it depends on Motif, this library is not built by default.
A GTK-based library providing some of the functionality of
<code>libdpstkXm</code> is available from
<A href="http://www.gyve.org/gtkDPS/">the gtkDPS site</A>.</p>

<H4><A NAME="4"></A>2.1.1. Libdps and Xt </H4>
<p>In X11R5, <code>libdps</code> did not depend on <code>libXt</code>.  In X11R6,
however, code was added to make the Xt main loop dispatch to sundry
code on DPS events; with this addition, all programs that link with
<code>libdps</code> need to link with <code>libXt</code>, whether they use Xt or not.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is unfortunately true of the version of
<code>libdps</code> included with XFree86.  We are currently considering
various solutions to this problem (including the use of weak linker
symbols or splitting off the guilty functions into a separate
library).</p>

<H3><A NAME="5"></A>2.2. Client-side tools <A NAME="sec:tools"></A> 
</H3>
<p>In addition to the libraries, the client side of DPS consists of two
utilities.</p>
<p>The <code>makepsres</code> utility is used for managing PostScript resources.
Its basic operation consists in walking recursively a filesystem tree,
noting all resources, and then writing out a ``Unix PostScript
Resources,'' file, basically a directory of all the resources found.
This utility is documented in the <A href="makepsres.1.html">makepsres(1)</A> manual page.</p>
<p>The <code>pswrap</code> utility is a stub generator for PostScript clients.
Roughly speaking, it takes as its input textual PostScript code, and
generates a collection of C functions that transmit that code in
pre-tokenised form to the DPS extension.  <code>Pswrap</code> is documented in
[PSWRAP].</p>

<H3><A NAME="6"></A>2.3. Sample clients </H3>
<p>XFree86 contains three sample DPS clients, <code>dpsinfo</code>,
<code>dpsexec</code> and <code>texteroids</code>.  They are documented in their
respective manual pages.</p>
<p>A number of sample clients that depend on Motif are available in <A href="ftp://dps.sourceforge.net/pub/ftp/DPS.tar.gz">ftp://dps.sourceforge.net/pub/ftp/DPS.tar.gz</A>.  Additional
sample clients can be found as part of GtkDPS (see above).</p>
<p>The GNUstep environment can be compiled to use DPS for
all rendering; for more information, please see
<A href="http://www.gnustep.org">the GNUstep site</A>.</p>
