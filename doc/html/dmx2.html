  <H2><A NAME="4"></A>2. Development plan </H2>
<p>This section describes the development plan from approximately June
2001 through July 2003.</p>

<H3><A NAME="5"></A>2.1. Bootstrap code </H3>
<p>To allow for rapid development of the DMX server by multiple
developers during the first development stage, the problem will be
broken down into three tasks: the overall DMX framework, back-end
rendering services and input device handling services.  However, before
the work begins on these tasks, a simple framework that each developer
could use was implemented to bootstrap the development effort.  This
framework renders to a single back-end server and provides dummy input
devices (i.e., the keyboard and mouse).  The simple back-end rendering
service was implemented using the shadow framebuffer support currently
available in the XFree86 environment.</p>

<p>Using this bootstrapping framework, each developer has been able to
work on each of the tasks listed above independently as follows: the
framework will be extended to handle arbitrary back-end server
configurations; the back-end rendering services will be transitioned to
the more efficient Xnest-style implementation; and, an input device
framework to handle various input devices via the input extension will
be developed.</p>

<p>Status: The boot strap code is complete.  </p>


<H3><A NAME="6"></A>2.2. Input device handling </H3>
<p>An X server (including the front-end X server) requires two core
input devices -- a keyboard and a pointer (mouse).  These core devices
are handled and required by the core X11 protocol.  Additional types of
input devices may be attached and utilized via the XInput extension.
These are usually referred to as ``XInput extension devices'',</p>

<p>There are some options as to how the front-end X server gets its core
input devices:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Local Input. The physical input devices (e.g., keyboard and
mouse) can be attached directly to the front-end X server.  In this
case, the keyboard and mouse on the machine running the front-end X
server will be used.  The front-end will have drivers to read the
raw input from those devices and convert it into the required X
input events (e.g., key press/release, pointer button press/release,
pointer motion).  The front-end keyboard driver will keep track of
keyboard properties such as key and modifier mappings, autorepeat
state, keyboard sound and led state.  Similarly the front-end
pointer driver will keep track if pointer properties such as the
button mapping and movement acceleration parameters.  With this
option, input is handled fully in the front-end X server, and the
back-end X servers are used in a display-only mode.  This option was
implemented and works for a limited number of Linux-specific
devices.  Adding additional local input devices for other
architectures is expected to be relatively simple.

<p>The following options are available for implementing local input
devices:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The XFree86 X server has modular input drivers that could
be adapted for this purpose.  The mouse driver supports a wide
range of mouse types and interfaces, as well as a range of
Operating System platforms.  The keyboard driver in XFree86 is
not currently as modular as the mouse driver, but could be made
so.  The XFree86 X server also has a range of other input
drivers for extended input devices such as tablets and touch
screens.  Unfortunately, the XFree86 drivers are generally
complex, often simultaneously providing support for multiple
devices across multiple architectures; and rely so heavily on
XFree86-specific helper-functions, that this option was not
pursued.

</li>
<li>The <code>TinyX</code> X server in XFree86 has built-in drivers that
support PS/2 mice and keyboard under Linux.  The mouse driver
can indirectly handle other mouse types if the Linux utility
<code>gpm</code> is used as to translate the native mouse protocol into
PS/2 mouse format.  These drivers could be adapted and built in
to the front-end X server if this range of hardware and OS
support is sufficient.  While much simpler than the XFree86
drivers, the <code>TinyX</code> drivers were not used for the DMX
implementation.
</li>
<li>Reimplementation of keyboard and mouse drivers from
scratch for the DMX framework.  Because keyboard and mouse
drivers are relatively trivial to implement, this pathway was
selected.  Other drivers in the X source tree were referenced,
and significant contributions from other drivers are noted in
the DMX source code.</li>
</ol>
</p>

</li>
<li>Backend Input.  The front-end can make use of the core input
devices attached to one or more of the back-end X servers.  Core
input events from multiple back-ends are merged into a single input
event stream.  This can work sanely when only a single set of input
devices is used at any given time.  The keyboard and pointer state
will be handled in the front-end, with changes propagated to the
back-end servers as needed.  This option was implemented and works
well.  Because the core pointer on a back-end controls the hardware
mouse on that back-end, core pointers cannot be treated as XInput
extension devices.  However, all back-end XInput extensions devices
can be mapped to either DMX core or DMX XInput extension devices.
</li>
<li>Console Input.  The front-end server could create a console
window that is displayed on an X server independent of the back-end
X servers.  This console window could display things like the
physical screen layout, and the front-end could get its core input
events from events delivered to the console window.  This option was
implemented and works well.  To help the human navigate, window
outlines are also displayed in the console window.  Further, console
windows can be used as either core or XInput extension devices.
</li>
<li>Other options were initially explored, but they were all
partial subsets of the options listed above and, hence, are
irrelevant.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Although extended input devices are not specifically mentioned in the
Distributed X requirements, the options above were all implemented so
that XInput extension devices were supported.</p>

<p>The bootstrap code (Xdmx) had dummy input devices, and these are
still supported in the final version.  These do the necessary
initialization to satisfy the X server's requirements for core pointer
and keyboard devices, but no input events are ever generated.</p>

<p>Status: The input code is complete.  Because of the complexity of the
XFree86 input device drivers (and their heavy reliance on XFree86
infrastructure), separate low-level device drivers were implemented for
Xdmx.  The following kinds of drivers are supported (in general, the
devices can be treated arbitrarily as "core" input devices or as XInput
"extension" devices; and multiple instances of different kinds of
devices can be simultaneously available):
<ol>
<li> A "dummy" device drive that never generates events.
</li>
<li> "Local" input is from the low-level hardware on which the
Xdmx binary is running.  This is the only area where using the
XFree86 driver infrastructure would have been helpful, and then
only partially, since good support for generic USB devices does
not yet exist in XFree86 (in any case, XFree86 and TinyX driver
code was used where possible).  Currently, the following local
devices are supported under Linux (porting to other operating
systems should be fairly straightforward):
<ul>
<li>Linux keyboard</li>
<li>Linux serial mouse (MS)</li>
<li>Linux PS/2 mouse</li>
<li>USB keyboard</li>
<li>USB mouse</li>
<li>USB generic device (e.g., joystick, gamepad, etc.)</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li> "Backend" input is taken from one or more of the back-end
displays.  In this case, events are taken from the back-end X
server and are converted to Xdmx events.  Care must be taken so
that the sprite moves properly on the display from which input
is being taken.
</li>
<li> "Console" input is taken from an X window that Xdmx
creates on the operator's display (i.e., on the machine running
the Xdmx binary).  When the operator's mouse is inside the
console window, then those events are converted to Xdmx events.
Several special features are available: the console can display
outlines of windows that are on the Xdmx display (to facilitate
navigation), the cursor can be confined to the console, and a
"fine" mode can be activated to allow very precise cursor
positioning.</li>
</ol>
</p>



<H3><A NAME="7"></A>2.3. Output device handling </H3>
<p>The output of the DMX system displays rendering and windowing
requests across multiple screens.  The screens are typically arranged in
a grid such that together they represent a single large display.</p>

<p>The output section of the DMX code consists of two parts.  The first
is in the front-end proxy X server (Xdmx), which accepts client
connections, manages the windows, and potentially renders primitives but
does not actually display any of the drawing primitives.  The second
part is the back-end X server(s), which accept commands from the
front-end server and display the results on their screens.</p>

<H4><A NAME="8"></A>2.3.1. Initialization </H4>
<p>The DMX front-end must first initialize its screens by connecting to
each of the back-end X servers and collecting information about each of
these screens.  However, the information collected from the back-end X
servers might be inconsistent.  Handling these cases can be difficult
and/or inefficient.  For example, a two screen system has one back-end X
server running at 16bpp while the second is running at 32bpp.
Converting rendering requests (e.g., XPutImage() or XGetImage()
requests) to the appropriate bit depth can be very time consuming.
Analyzing these cases to determine how or even if it is possible to
handle them is required.  The current Xinerama code handles many of
these cases (e.g., in PanoramiXConsolidate()) and will be used as a
starting point.  In general, the best solution is to use homogeneous X
servers and display devices.  Using back-end servers with the same depth
is a requirement of the final DMX implementation.</p>

<p>Once this screen consolidation is finished, the relative position of
each back-end X server's screen in the unified screen is initialized.  A
full-screen window is opened on each of the back-end X servers, and the
cursor on each screen is turned off.  The final DMX implementation can
also make use of a partial-screen window, or multiple windows per
back-end screen.</p>

<H4><A NAME="9"></A>2.3.2. Handling rendering requests </H4>
<p>After initialization, X applications connect to the front-end server.
There are two possible implementations of how rendering and windowing
requests are handled in the DMX system:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>A shadow framebuffer is used in the front-end server as the
render target.  In this option, all protocol requests are completely
handled in the front-end server.  All state and resources are
maintained in the front-end including a shadow copy of the entire
framebuffer.  The framebuffers attached to the back-end servers are
updated by XPutImage() calls with data taken directly from the
shadow framebuffer.

<p>This solution suffers from two main problems.  First, it does not
take advantage of any accelerated hardware available in the system.
Second, the size of the XPutImage() calls can be quite large and
thus will be limited by the bandwidth available.</p>

<p>The initial DMX implementation used a shadow framebuffer by
default.</p>

</li>
<li>Rendering requests are sent to each back-end server for
handling (as is done in the Xnest server described above).  In this
option, certain protocol requests are handled in the front-end
server and certain requests are repackaged and then sent to the
back-end servers.  The framebuffer is distributed across the
multiple back-end servers.  Rendering to the framebuffer is handled
on each back-end and can take advantage of any acceleration
available on the back-end servers' graphics display device.  State
is maintained both in the front and back-end servers.

<p>This solution suffers from two main drawbacks.  First, protocol
requests are sent to all back-end servers -- even those that will
completely clip the rendering primitive -- which wastes bandwidth
and processing time.  Second, state is maintained both in the front-
and back-end servers.  These drawbacks are not as severe as in
option 1 (above) and can either be overcome through optimizations or
are acceptable.  Therefore, this option will be used in the final
implementation.</p>

<p>The final DMX implementation defaults to this mechanism, but also
supports the shadow framebuffer mechanism.  Several optimizations
were implemented to eliminate the drawbacks of the default
mechanism.  These optimizations are described the section below and
in Phase II of the Development Results (see appendix).</p>

</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Status: Both the shadow framebuffer and Xnest-style code is complete.</p>


<H3><A NAME="10"></A>2.4. Optimizing DMX </H3>
<p>Initially, the Xnest-style solution's performance will be measured
and analyzed to determine where the performance bottlenecks exist.
There are four main areas that will be addressed.</p>

<p>First, to obtain reasonable interactivity with the first development
phase, XSync() was called after each protocol request.  The XSync()
function flushes any pending protocol requests.  It then waits for the
back-end to process the request and send a reply that the request has
completed.  This happens with each back-end server and performance
greatly suffers.  As a result of the way XSync() is called in the first
development phase, the batching that the X11 library performs is
effectively defeated.  The XSync() call usage will be analyzed and
optimized by batching calls and performing them at regular intervals,
except where interactivity will suffer (e.g., on cursor movements).</p>

<p>Second, the initial Xnest-style solution described above sends the
repackaged protocol requests to all back-end servers regardless of
whether or not they would be completely clipped out.  The requests that
are trivially rejected on the back-end server wastes the limited
bandwidth available.  By tracking clipping changes in the DMX X server's
windowing code (e.g., by opening, closing, moving or resizing windows),
we can determine whether or not back-end windows are visible so that
trivial tests in the front-end server's GC ops drawing functions can
eliminate these unnecessary protocol requests.</p>

<p>Third, each protocol request will be analyzed to determine if it is
possible to break the request into smaller pieces at display boundaries.
The initial ones to be analyzed are put and get image requests since
they will require the greatest bandwidth to transmit data between the
front and back-end servers.  Other protocol requests will be analyzed
and those that will benefit from breaking them into smaller requests
will be implemented.</p>

<p>Fourth, an extension is being considered that will allow font glyphs to
be transferred from the front-end DMX X server to each back-end server.
This extension will permit the front-end to handle all font requests and
eliminate the requirement that all back-end X servers share the exact
same fonts as the front-end server.  We are investigating the
feasibility of this extension during this development phase.</p>

<p>Other potential optimizations will be determined from the performance
analysis.</p>

<p>Please note that in our initial design, we proposed optimizing BLT
operations (e.g., XCopyArea() and window moves) by developing an
extension that would allow individual back-end servers to directly copy
pixel data to other back-end servers.  This potential optimization was
in response to the simple image movement implementation that required
potentially many calls to GetImage() and PutImage().  However, the
current Xinerama implementation handles these BLT operations
differently.  Instead of copying data to and from screens, they generate
expose events -- just as happens in the case when a window is moved from
off a screen to on screen.  This approach saves the limited bandwidth
available between front and back-end servers and is being standardized
with Xinerama.  It also eliminates the potential setup problems and
security issues resulting from having each back-end server open
connections to all other back-end servers.  Therefore, we suggest
accepting Xinerama's expose event solution.</p>

<p>Also note that the approach proposed in the second and third
optimizations might cause backing store algorithms in the back-end to be
defeated, so a DMX X server configuration flag will be added to disable
these optimizations.</p>

<p>Status: The optimizations proposed above are complete.  It was
determined that the using the xfs font server was sufficient and
creating a new mechanism to pass glyphs was redundant; therefore, the
fourth optimization proposed above was not included in DMX.</p>


<H3><A NAME="11"></A>2.5. DMX X extension support </H3>
<p>The DMX X server keeps track of all the windowing information on the
back-end X servers, but does not currently export this information to
any client applications.  An extension will be developed to pass the
screen information and back-end window IDs to DMX-aware clients.  These
clients can then use this information to directly connect to and render
to the back-end windows.  Bypassing the DMX X server allows DMX-aware
clients to break up complex rendering requests on their own and send
them directly to the windows on the back-end server's screens.  An
example of a client that can make effective use of this extension is
Chromium.</p>

<p>Status: The extension, as implemented, is fully documented in
"Client-to-Server DMX Extension to the X Protocol".  Future changes
might be required based on feedback and other proposed enhancements to
DMX.  Currently, the following facilities are supported:
<ol>
<li>Screen information (clipping rectangle for each screen relative
to the virtual screen)</li>
<li>Window information (window IDs and clipping information for each
back-end window that corresponds to each DMX window)</li>
<li>Input device information (mappings from DMX device IDs to
back-end device IDs)</li>
<li>Force window creation (so that a client can override the
server-side lazy window creation optimization)</li>
<li>Reconfiguration (so that a client can request that a screen
position be changed)</li>
<li>Addition and removal of back-end servers and back-end and
console inputs.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<H3><A NAME="12"></A>2.6. Common X extension support </H3>
<p>The XInput, XKeyboard and Shape extensions are commonly used
extensions to the base X11 protocol.  XInput allows multiple and
non-standard input devices to be accessed simultaneously.  These input
devices can be connected to either the front-end or back-end servers.
XKeyboard allows much better keyboard mappings control.  Shape adds
support for arbitrarily shaped windows and is used by various window
managers.  Nearly all potential back-end X servers make these extensions
available, and support for each one will be added to the DMX system.</p>

<p>In addition to the extensions listed above, support for the X
Rendering extension (Render) is being developed.  Render adds digital
image composition to the rendering model used by the X Window System.
While this extension is still under development by Keith Packard of HP,
support for the current version will be added to the DMX system.</p>

<p>Support for the XTest extension was added during the first
development phase.</p>

<p>Status: The following extensions are supported and are discussed in
more detail in Phase IV of the Development Results (see appendix):
BIG-REQUESTS,
DEC-XTRAP,
DMX,
DPMS,
Extended-Visual-Information,
GLX,
LBX,
RECORD,
RENDER,
SECURITY,
SHAPE,
SYNC,
X-Resource,
XC-APPGROUP,
XC-MISC,
XFree86-Bigfont,
XINERAMA,
XInputExtension,
XKEYBOARD, and
XTEST.</p>

<H3><A NAME="13"></A>2.7. OpenGL support </H3>
<p>OpenGL support using the Mesa code base exists in XFree86 release 4
and later.  Currently, the direct rendering infrastructure (DRI)
provides accelerated OpenGL support for local clients and unaccelerated
OpenGL support (i.e., software rendering) is provided for non-local
clients.</p>

<p>The single head OpenGL support in XFree86 4.x will be extended to use
the DMX system.  When the front and back-end servers are on the same
physical hardware, it is possible to use the DRI to directly render to
the back-end servers.  First, the existing DRI will be extended to
support multiple display heads, and then to support the DMX system.
OpenGL rendering requests will be direct rendering to each back-end X
server.  The DRI will request the screen layout (either from the
existing Xinerama extension or a DMX-specific extension).  Support for
synchronized swap buffers will also be added (on hardware that supports
it).  Note that a single front-end server with a single back-end server
on the same physical machine can emulate accelerated indirect rendering.</p>

<p>When the front and back-end servers are on different physical
hardware or are using non-XFree86 4.x X servers, a mechanism to render
primitives across the back-end servers will be provided.  There are
several options as to how this can be implemented.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The existing OpenGL support in each back-end server can be
used by repackaging rendering primitives and sending them to each
back-end server.  This option is similar to the unoptimized
Xnest-style approach mentioned above.  Optimization of this solution
is beyond the scope of this project and is better suited to other
distributed rendering systems.
</li>
<li>Rendering to a pixmap in the front-end server using the
current XFree86 4.x code, and then displaying to the back-ends via
calls to XPutImage() is another option.  This option is similar to
the shadow frame buffer approach mentioned above.  It is slower and
bandwidth intensive, but has the advantage that the back-end servers
are not required to have OpenGL support.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>These, and other, options will be investigated in this phase of the
work.</p>

<p>Work by others have made Chromium DMX-aware.  Chromium will use the
DMX X protocol extension to obtain information about the back-end
servers and will render directly to those servers, bypassing DMX.</p>

<p>Status: OpenGL support by the glxProxy extension was implemented by
SGI and has been integrated into the DMX code base.</p>
