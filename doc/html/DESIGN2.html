  <H2><A NAME="2"></A>2. The XF86Config File </H2>

<p>The XF86Config file format is similar to the old format, with the following
changes:</p>

<H3><A NAME="3"></A>2.1. <b>Device</b> section </H3>

<p>The <b>Device</b> sections are similar to what they used to be, and
describe hardware-specific information for a single video card.
<b>Device</b>
Some new keywords are added:</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Driver "drivername"</b><dd><p>Specifies the name of the driver to be used for the card.  This
is mandatory.</p>
<dt><b>BusID "busslot"</b><dd><p>Specifies uniquely the location of the card on the bus.  The
purpose is to identify particular cards in a multi-headed
configuration.  The format of the argument is intentionally
vague, and may be architecture dependent.  For a PCI bus, it
is something like "bus:slot:func".</p>
</dl>
</p>
<p>A <b>Device</b> section is considered ``active'' if there is a reference
to it in an active <b>Screen</b> section.</p>

<H3><A NAME="4"></A>2.2. <b>Screen</b> section </H3>

<p>The <b>Screen</b> sections are similar to what they used to be.  They
no longer have a <b>Driver</b> keyword, but an <b>Identifier</b> keyword
is added.  (The <b>Driver</b> keyword may be accepted in place of the
<b>Identifier</b> keyword for compatibility purposes.)  The identifier
can be used to identify which screen is to be active when multiple
<b>Screen</b> sections are present.  It is possible to specify the active
screen from the command line.  A default is chosen in the absence
of one being specified.  A <b>Screen</b> section is considered ``active''
if there is a reference to it either from the command line, or from
an active <b>ServerLayout</b> section.</p>

<H3><A NAME="5"></A>2.3. <b>InputDevice</b> section </H3>

<p>The <b>InputDevice</b> section is a new section that describes
configuration information for input devices.  It replaces the old
<b>Keyboard</b>, <b>Pointer</b> and <b>XInput</b>
sections.  Like the <b>Device</b> section, it has two mandatory keywords:
<b>Identifier</b> and <b>Driver</b>.  For compatibility purposes the old
<b>Keyboard</b> and <b>Pointer</b> sections are
converted by the parser into <b>InputDevice</b> sections as follows:</p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b><b>Keyboard</b></b><dd><p><b>Identifier</b> "Implicit Core Keyboard"<br>
<b>Driver</b> "keyboard"</p>
<dt><b><b>Pointer</b></b><dd><p><b>Identifier</b> "Implicit Core Pointer"<br>
<b>Driver</b> "mouse"</p>
</dl>
</p>
<p>An <b>InputDevice</b> section is considered active if there is a
reference to it in an active <b>ServerLayout</b> section.  An
<b>InputDevice</b> section may also be referenced implicitly if there
is no <b>ServerLayout</b> section, if the <code>-screen</code> command
line options is used, or if the <b>ServerLayout</b> section doesn't
reference any <b>InputDevice</b> sections.  In this case, the first
sections with drivers "keyboard" and "mouse" are used as the core
keyboard and pointer respectively.</p>

<H3><A NAME="6"></A>2.4. <b>ServerLayout</b> section </H3>

<p>The <b>ServerLayout</b> section is a new section that is used to identify
which <b>Screen</b> sections are to be used in a multi-headed configuration,
and the relative layout of those screens.  It also identifies which
<b>InputDevice</b> sections are to be used.  Each <b>ServerLayout</b> section
has an identifier, a list of <b>Screen</b> section identifiers, and a list of
<b>InputDevice</b> section identifiers.  <b>ServerFlags</b> options may also be
included in a <b>ServerLayout</b> section, making it possible to override
the global values in the <b>ServerFlags</b> section.</p>
<p>A <b>ServerLayout</b> section can be made active by being referenced on
the command line.  In the absence of this, a default will be chosen
(the first one found).  The screen names may optionally be followed
by a number specifying the preferred screen number, and optionally
by information specifying the physical positioning of the screen,
either in absolute terms or relative to another screen (or screens).
When no screen number is specified, they are numbered according to
the order in which they are listed.  The old (now obsolete) method
of providing the positioning information is to give the names of
the four adjacent screens.  The order of these is top, bottom, left,
right.  Here is an example of a <b>ServerLayout</b> section for two
screens using the old method, with the second located to the right
of the first:</p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
      Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "Main Layout"
        Screen     0 "Screen 1" ""  ""  ""  "Screen 2"
        Screen     1 "Screen 2"
        Screen     "Screen 3"
      EndSection
    
</pre>
<hr>
</p>
<p>The preferred way of specifying the layout is to explicitly specify
the screen's location in absolute terms or relative to another
screen.</p>
<p>In the absolute case, the upper left corner's coordinates are given
after the <b>Absolute</b> keyword.  If the coordinates are
omitted, a value of <code>(0,0)</code> is assumed.  An example
of absolute positioning follows:</p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
      Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "Main Layout"
        Screen     0 "Screen 1" Absolute 0 0
        Screen     1 "Screen 2" Absolute 1024 0
        Screen     "Screen 3" Absolute 2048 0
      EndSection
    
</pre>
<hr>
</p>
<p>In the relative case, the position is specified by either using one of
the following keywords followed by the name of the reference screen:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>RightOf<br>
LeftOf<br>
Above<br>
Below<br>
Relative</b>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>When the <b>Relative</b> keyword is used, the reference screen
name is followed by the coordinates of the new screen's origin
relative to reference screen.  The following example shows how to use
some of the relative positioning options.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
      Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier "Main Layout"
        Screen     0 "Screen 1"
        Screen     1 "Screen 2" RightOf "Screen 1"
        Screen     "Screen 3" Relative "Screen 1" 2048 0
      EndSection
    
</pre>
<hr>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="7"></A>2.5. Options </H3>

<p>Options are used more extensively.  They may appear in most sections
now.  Options related to drivers can be present in the <b>Screen</b>,
<b>Device</b> and <b>Monitor</b> sections and the <b>Display</b> subsections.
The order of precedence is <b>Display</b>, <b>Screen</b>, <b>Monitor</b>,
<b>Device</b>.  Options have been extended to allow an optional value
to be specified in addition to the option name.  For more details
about options, see the 
<A HREF="DESIGN10.html#options">Options</A> section
for details.</p>
