<p>This section reviews relevant previous work.</p>
<H3><A NAME="6"></A>2.1. VNC </H3>
<H4><A NAME="7"></A>2.1.1. Scaling under VNC </H4>
<p>When using the <code>vncviewer</code> program for Windows, it
is possible to specify a scaling factor (as numerator and
denominator).  When scaling is in effect, the viewer
software uses StretchBlt (instead of BitBlt) to display
the pixels for the user.  When this call is made, the
viewer already has received all of the pixel information
(at full unscaled resolution).</p>
<p>The scaling in VNC is primitive.  It does not conserve
bandwidth, it does not treat textual information
differently (i.e., by using a suitably scaled font), and
it does not provide any anti-aliasing other than that
provided by the underlying (Windows-only) system library.</p>
<H3><A NAME="8"></A>2.2. The X Video Extension </H3>
<p>The X Video Extension is a widely-available extension to the
X11 protocol that provides support for streaming video.
Integral to this support is the ability to arbitrarily scale
the output.  In version 2.2 of the X Video specification,
support for scaled still images was provided, using both
shared memory and traditional transport.  The API for this
support uses calls that are quite similar to XCreateWindow,
XPutImage, and XShmPutImage.  Currently, most of the drivers
implemented in XFree86 only support data in various YUV
formats.  However, several modern video adaptors support RGB
as well.</p>
<p>Note, though, that the target output for this scaling is an
overlay plane -- so X Video provides functionality that is
fundamentally different from that provided by the Windows
StrechBlt call.</p>
