  <H2><A NAME="1"></A>1. Introduction </H2>
<H3><A NAME="2"></A>1.1. The Distributed Multihead X Server </H3>
<p>Current Open Source multihead solutions are limited to a single
physical machine.  A single X server controls multiple display devices,
which can be arranged as independent heads or unified into a single
desktop (with Xinerama).  These solutions are limited to the number of
physical devices that can co-exist in a single machine (e.g., due to the
number of AGP/PCI slots available for graphics cards).  Thus, large
tiled displays are not currently possible.  The work described in this
paper will eliminate the requirement that the display devices reside in
the same physical machine.  This will be accomplished by developing a
front-end proxy X server that will control multiple back-end X servers
that make up the large display.</p>

<p>The overall structure of the distributed multihead X (DMX) project is
as follows: A single front-end X server will act as a proxy to a set of
back-end X servers, which handle all of the visible rendering.  X
clients will connect to the front-end server just as they normally would
to a regular X server.  The front-end server will present an abstracted
view to the client of a single large display.  This will ensure that all
standard X clients will continue to operate without modification
(limited, as always, by the visuals and extensions provided by the X
server).  Clients that are DMX-aware will be able to use an extension to
obtain information about the back-end servers (e.g., for placement of
pop-up windows, window alignments by the window manager, etc.).</p>

<p>The architecture of the DMX server is divided into two main sections:
input (e.g., mouse and keyboard events) and output (e.g., rendering and
windowing requests).  Each of these are describe briefly below, and the
rest of this design document will describe them in greater detail.</p>

<p>The DMX server can receive input from three general types of input
devices: "local" devices that are physically attached to the machine on
which DMX is running, "backend" devices that are physically attached to
one or more of the back-end X servers (and that generate events via the
X protocol stream from the backend), and "console" devices that can be
abstracted from any non-back-end X server.  Backend and console devices
are treated differently because the pointer device on the back-end X
server also controls the location of the hardware X cursor.  Full
support for XInput extension devices is provided.</p>

<p>Rendering requests will be accepted by the front-end server; however,
rendering to visible windows will be broken down as needed and sent to
the appropriate back-end server(s) via X11 library calls for actual
rendering.  The basic framework will follow a Xnest-style approach.  GC
state will be managed in the front-end server and sent to the
appropriate back-end server(s) as required.  Pixmap rendering will (at
least initially) be handled by the front-end X server.  Windowing
requests (e.g., ordering, mapping, moving, etc.) will handled in the
front-end server.  If the request requires a visible change, the
windowing operation will be translated into requests for the appropriate
back-end server(s).  Window state will be mirrored in the back-end
server(s) as needed.</p>

<H3><A NAME="3"></A>1.2. Layout of Paper </H3>
<p>The next section describes the general development plan that was
actually used for implementation.  The final section discusses
outstanding issues at the conclusion of development.  The first appendix
provides low-level technical detail that may be of interest to those
intimately familiar with the X server architecture.  The final appendix
describes the four phases of development that were performed during the
first two years of development.</p>

<p>The final year of work was divided into 9 tasks that are not
described in specific sections of this document.  The major tasks during
that time were the enhancement of the reconfiguration ability added in
Phase IV, addition of support for a dynamic number of back-end displays
(instead of a hard-coded limit), and the support for back-end display
and input removal and addition.  This work is mentioned in this paper,
but is not covered in detail.</p>
