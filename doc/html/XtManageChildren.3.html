<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XtManageChildren</i>   function
performs the following: </dl>
<p>
Issues an error if the children do not all have
the same parent or if the parent is not a subclass of  <i>compositeWidgetClass</i>.
  </dl>
<p>
Returns immediately if the common parent is being destroyed; otherwise,
for each unique child on the list, <i>XtManageChildren</i>   ignores the child
if it already is managed or is being destroyed and marks it if not. </dl>
<p>
If the
parent is realized and after all children have been marked, it makes some
of the newly managed children viewable: <dl></dl>
<p>
Calls the change_managed routine
of the widgets' parent. </dl>
<p>
Calls <i>XtRealizeWidget</i>   on each previously unmanaged
child that is unrealized. </dl>
<p>
Maps each previously unmanaged child that has
map_when_managed  <i>True</i>.   </dl>
<p>
Managing children is independent of the ordering
of children and independent of creating and deleting children. The layout
routine of the parent should consider children whose managed field is <i>True</i>
  and should ignore all other children. Note that some composite widgets,
especially fixed boxes, call <i>XtManageChild</i>   from their insert_child procedure.
<p>
If the parent widget is realized, its change_managed procedure is called
to notify it that its set of managed children has changed. The parent can
reposition and resize any of its children. It moves each child as needed
by calling  <i>XtMoveWidget</i>,   which first updates the x and y fields and
then calls <i>XMoveWindow</i>   if the widget is realized. <p>
The <i>XtManageChild</i>  
function constructs a <i>WidgetList</i>   of length one and calls <i>XtManageChildren</i>.
  <p>
The <i>XtUnmanageChildren</i>   function performs the following: </dl>
<p>
Issues an error
if the children do not all have the same parent or if the parent is not
a subclass of  <i>compositeWidgetClass</i>.   </dl>
<p>
Returns immediately if the common
parent is being destroyed; otherwise, for each unique child on the list,
 <i>XtUnmanageChildren</i>   performs the following: <dl></dl>
<p>
Ignores the child if it already
is unmanaged or is being destroyed and marks it if not. </dl>
<p>
If the child is
realized, it makes it nonvisible by unmapping it. </dl>
</dl>
<p>
Calls the change_managed
routine of the widgets' parent after all children have been marked if the
parent is realized. <p>
<i>XtUnmanageChildren</i>   does not destroy the children widgets.
Removing widgets from a parent's managed set is often a temporary banishment,
and, some time later, you may manage the children again. <p>
The <i>XtUnmanageChild</i>
  function constructs a widget list of length one and calls <i>XtUnmanageChildren</i>.
  <p>
The <i>XtChangeManagedSet</i>   function performs the following: </dl>
<p>
Issues an error
if the widgets specified in the <i>manage_children</i> and the <i>unmanage_children</i>
lists to no all have the same parent, or if that parent is not a subclass
of compositeWidgetClass. </dl>
<p>
Returns immediately if the common parent is being
destroyed. </dl>
<p>
If no <i>CompositeClassExtension</i>   is defined, or a <i>CompositeClassExtension</i>
  is defined but with an <i>allows_change_managed_set</i> field with a value of
<i>False</i>,   and <i>XtChangeManagedSet</i>   was invoked with a non-NULL <i>do_change_proc</i>
procedure  then <i>XtChangeManagedSet</i>   performs the following: <dl></dl>
<p>
Calls <i>XtUnmanageChildren</i>
  (<i>unmanage_children</i>, <i>num_unmanage_children</i>). </dl>
<p>
Calls the <i>do_change_proc</i> specified.
</dl>
<p>
Calls <i>XtManageChildren</i>   (<i>manage_children</i>, <i>num_manage_children</i>) and then
returns immediately. </dl>
</dl>
<p>
Otherwise, if a <i>CompositeClassExtension</i>   is defined
with an <i>allows_change_managed_set</i> field with a value of <i>True</i>,   or if no
<i>CompositeClassExtension</i>   is defined, and <i>XtChangeManagedSet</i>was   <i>do_change_proc</i>
procedure, then the following is performed: <dl></dl>
<p>
For each child on the <i>unmanage_children</i>
list; if the child is already unmanaged or is being destroyed it is ignored,
otherwise it is marked as being unmanaged and if it is realized it is made
nonvisible by being unmapped. </dl>
<p>
If the <i>do_change_proc</i> procdedure is non-NULL
then it is invoked as specified. </dl>
<p>
For each child on the <i>manage_children</i> list;
if the child is already managed or it is being destroyed it is ignored,
otherwise it is marked as managed </dl>
</dl>
<p>
If the parent is realized and after all
children have been marked, the change_managed method of the parent is invoked
and subsequently some of the newly managed children are made viewable by:
<dl></dl>
<p>
Calling <i>XtRealizeWidget</i>   on each of the previously unmanaged child that
is unrealized. </dl>
<p>
Mapping each previously unmanaged child that has <i>map_when_managed</i>
<i>True</i>.   </dl>
<p>
The <i>XtIsManaged</i>   function returns <i>True</i>   if the specified widget
is of class RectObj or any subclass thereof and is managed, or <i>False</i>  
otherwise.
