  <H2><A NAME="39"></A>7. Configuration Examples </H2>

<p>This section shows some example <code>InputDevice</code> section for 
popular mice.  All the examples assume that the mouse is connected to 
the PS/2 mouse port, and the OS supports the PS/2 mouse initialization.
It is also assumed that <code>/dev/mouse</code> is
a link to the PS/2 mouse port.</p>
<p>Logitech MouseMan+ has 4 buttons and a wheel.  The following example
makes the wheel movement available as the button 5 and 6.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"MouseMan+"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/mouse"
	Option		"Protocol"	"MouseManPlusPS/2"
	Option		"Buttons"	"6"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"5 6"
EndSection
</pre>
<hr>
</p>
<p>You can change button number assignment using the <code>xmodmap</code>
command AFTER you start the X server with the above configuration.
You may not like to use the wheel as the button 2 and rather want
the side button (button 4) act like the button 2.  You may also
want to map the wheel movement to the button 4 and 5.
This can be done by the following command:</p>
<p>
<pre>
	xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 6 3 2 4 5"
</pre>
</p>
<p>After this command is run, the correspondence between the buttons and 
button numbers will be as shown in the following table.</p>
<p>
<pre>
Physical Buttons	Reported as:
------------------------------------
1 Left Button		  Button 1
2 Wheel Button		  Button 6
3 Right Button		  Button 3
4 Side Button		  Button 2
5 Wheel Negative Move	  Button 4
6 Wheel Positive Move	  Button 5
</pre>
</p>
<p>For the MS IntelliMouse Explorer which as a wheel and 5 buttons,
you may have the following <code>InputDevice</code> section. </p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"IntelliMouse Explorer"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/mouse"
	Option		"Protocol"	"ExplorerPS/2"
	Option		"Buttons"	"7"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"6 7"
EndSection
</pre>
<hr>
</p>
<p>The IntelliMouse Explorer has 5 buttons, thus, you should give "7"
to the <code>Buttons</code> option if you want to map the wheel movement
to buttons (6 and 7).
With this configuration, the correspondence between the buttons and
button numbers will be as follows:</p>
<p>
<pre>
Physical Buttons	Reported as:
------------------------------------
1 Left Button		  Button 1
2 Wheel Button		  Button 2
3 Right Button		  Button 3
4 Side Button 1		  Button 4
5 Side Button 2		  Button 5
6 Wheel Negative Move	  Button 6
7 Wheel Positive Move	  Button 7
</pre>
</p>
<p>You can change button number assignment using <code>xmodmap</code>
AFTER you started the X server with the above configuration.</p>
<p>
<pre>
	xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 4 7 5 6"
</pre>
</p>
<p>The above command will moves the side button 2 to the button 7 and
make the wheel movement reported as the button 5 and 6.  See 
the table below.</p>
<p>
<pre>
Physical Buttons	Reported as:
------------------------------------
1 Left Button		  Button 1
2 Wheel Button		  Button 2
3 Right Button		  Button 3
4 Side Button 1		  Button 4
5 Side Button 2		  Button 7
6 Wheel Negative Move	  Button 5
7 Wheel Positive Move	  Button 6
</pre>
</p>
<p>For the A4 Tech WinEasy mouse which has two wheels and 3 buttons,
you may have the following <code>InputDevice</code> section.  </p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"WinEasy"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"Device"	"/dev/mouse"
	Option		"Protocol"	"IMPS/2"
	Option		"Buttons"	"7"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"	"4 5 6 7"
EndSection
</pre>
<hr>
</p>
<p>The movement of the first wheel is mapped to the button 4 and 5.  The
second wheel's movement will be reported as the buttons 6 and 7.</p>
<p>The Kensington Expert mouse is really a trackball. It has 4 buttons
arranged in a rectangle around the ball.</p>
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "DLB"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option      "Protocol" "ThinkingMousePS/2"
	Option      "Buttons" "3"
	Option      "Emulate3Buttons"
	Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
	Option      "DragLockButtons" "2 1 4 3"
EndSection
</pre>
<hr>

In this example, button 2 is a drag lock button for button
number 1, and button 4 is a drag lock button for button 3.
Since button 2 is above button 1 and button 4 is above button 3
in the layout of this trackball, this is reasonable.</p>
<p>Because button 2 is being used as a drag lock, it can not be
used as an ordinary button. However, it can be activated by
using the "Emulate3Buttons" feature. However, some people my
be unable to press two buttons at the same time. They may
prefer the following <code>InputDevice</code> section which
defines button 4 as a master drag lock button, and leaves
button 2 free for ordinary use.
<hr>
<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier  "MasterDLB"
	Driver      "mouse"
	Option      "Protocol" "ThinkingMousePS/2"
	Option      "Buttons" "3"
	Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
	Option      "DragLockButtons" "4"
