<a name="1. REQUIREMENTS"></a>
<h2>1. REQUIREMENTS</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The shared memory
extension is provided only by some X servers. To find out if
your server supports the extension, use xdpyinfo(1). In
particular, to be able to use this extension, your system
must provide the SYSV shared memory primitives. There is not
an mmap-based version of this extension. To use shared
memory on Sun systems, you must have built your kernel with
SYSV shared memory enabled -- which is not the default
configuration. Additionally, the shared memeory maximum size
will need to be increased on both Sun and Digital systems;
the defaults are far too small for any useful work.</p>

<a name="2. WHAT IS PROVIDED"></a>
<h2>2. WHAT IS PROVIDED</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The basic
capability provided is that of shared memory XImages. This
is essentially a version of the ximage interface where the
actual image data is stored in a shared memory segment, and
thus need not be moved through the Xlib interprocess
communication channel. For large images, use of this
facility can result in some real performance increases.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Additionally, some
implementations provided shared memory pixmaps. These are 2
dimensional arrays of pixels in a format specified by the X
server, where the image data is stored in the shared memory
segment. Through use of shared memory pixmaps, it is
possible to change the contents of these pixmaps without
using any Xlib routines at all. Shared memory pixmaps can
only be supported when the X server can use regular virtual
memory for pixmap data; if the pixmaps are stored in some
magic graphics hardware, your application will not be able
to share them with the server. Xdpyinfo(1) doesn&rsquo;t
print this particular nugget of information.</p>

<a name="3. HOW TO USE THE SHARED MEMORY EXTENSION"></a>
<h2>3. HOW TO USE THE SHARED MEMORY EXTENSION</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Code which uses the
shared memory extension must include a number of header
files:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em"># include &lt;X11/Xlib.h&gt;        /* of course */
# include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
# include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;
# include &lt;X11/extensions/XShm.h&gt;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Of course, if the
system you are building on does not support shared memory,
the file XShm.h may not be present. You may want to make
liberal use of #ifdefs.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Any code which uses
the shared memory extension should first check to see that
the server provides the extension. You could always be
running over the net, or in some other environment where the
extension will not work. To perform this check, call
either</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">Status XShmQueryExtension (display)
        Display *display</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">or</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">Status XShmQueryVersion (display, major, minor, pixmaps)
        Display *display;
        int *major, *minor;
        Bool *pixmaps</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Where
&lsquo;&lsquo;display&rsquo;&rsquo; is, of course, the
display on which you are running. If the shared memory
extension may be used, the return value from either function
will be True; otherwise your program should operate using
conventional Xlib calls. When the extension is available,
<tt>XShmQueryVersion</tt> also returns
&lsquo;&lsquo;major&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;minor&rsquo;&rsquo; which are the version
numbers of the extension implementation, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;pixmaps&rsquo;&rsquo; which is True iff shared
memory pixmaps are supported.</p>

<a name="4. USE OF SHARED MEMORY XIMAGES"></a>
<h2>4. USE OF SHARED MEMORY XIMAGES</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The basic sequence
of operations for shared memory XImages is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">1 &minus; Create
the shared memory XImage structure <br>
2 &minus; Create a shared memory segment to store the image
data <br>
3 &minus; Inform the server about the shared memory segment
<br>
4 &minus; Use the shared memory XImage, much like a normal
one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To create a shared
memory XImage, use:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">XImage *XShmCreateImage (display, visual, depth, format, data,
                         shminfo, width, height)
        Display *display;
        Visual *visual;
        unsigned int depth, width, height;
        int format;
        char *data;
        XShmSegmentInfo *shminfo;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Most of the
arguments are the same as for XCreateImage; I will not go
through them here. Note, however, that there are no
&lsquo;&lsquo;offset&rsquo;&rsquo;,
&lsquo;&lsquo;bitmap_pad&rsquo;&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;&lsquo;bytes_per_line&rsquo;&rsquo; arguments. These
quantities will be defined by the server itself, and your
code needs to abide by them. Unless you have already
allocated the shared memory segment (see below), you should
pass in NULL for the &lsquo;&lsquo;data&rsquo;&rsquo;
pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">There is one
additional argument: &lsquo;&lsquo;shminfo&rsquo;&rsquo;,
which is a pointer to a structure of type XShmSegmentInfo.
You must allocate one of these structures such that it will
have a lifetime at least as long as that of the shared
memory XImage. There is no need to initialize this structure
before the call to XShmCreateImage.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The return value,
if all goes well, will be an XImage structure, which you can
use for the subsequent steps.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The next step is to
create the shared memory segment. This is best done after
the creation of the XImage, since you need to make use of
the information in that XImage to know how much memory to
allocate. To create the segment, you need a call like:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">shminfo.shmid = shmget (IPC_PRIVATE,
          image-&gt;bytes_per_line * image-&gt;height, IPC_CREAT|0777);</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">(assuming that you
have called your shared memory XImage
&lsquo;&lsquo;image&rsquo;&rsquo;). You should, of course,
follow the Rules and do error checking on all of these
system calls. Also, be sure to use the bytes_per_line field,
not the width you used to create the XImage as they may well
be different.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Note that the
shared memory ID returned by the system is stored in the
shminfo structure. The server will need that ID to attach
itself to the segment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Also note that, on
many systems for security reasons, the X server will only
accept to attach to the shared memory segment if it&rsquo;s
readable and writeable by &lsquo;&lsquo;other&rsquo;&rsquo;.
On systems where the X server is able to determine the uid
of the X client over a local transport, the shared memory
segment can be readable and writeable only by the uid of the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Next, attach this
shared memory segment to your process:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">shminfo.shmaddr = image-&gt;data = shmat (shminfo.shmid, 0, 0);</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The address
returned by shmat should be stored in *both* the XImage
structure and the shminfo structure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To finish filling
in the shminfo structure, you need to decide how you want
the server to attach to the shared memory segment, and set
the &lsquo;&lsquo;readOnly&rsquo;&rsquo; field as follows.
Normally, you would code:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">shminfo.readOnly = False;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If you set it to
True, the server will not be able to write to this segment,
and thus XShmGetImage calls will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Finally, tell the
server to attach to your shared memory segment with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">Status XShmAttach (display, shminfo);</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If all goes well,
you will get a non-zero status back, and your XImage is
ready for use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To write a shared
memory XImage into an X drawable, use XShmPutImage:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">Status XShmPutImage (display, d, gc, image, src_x, src_y,
                     dest_x, dest_y, width, height, send_event)
        Display *display;
        Drawable d;
        GC gc;
        XImage *image;
        int src_x, src_y, dest_x, dest_y;
        unsigned int width, height;
        bool send_event;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The interface is
identical to that of XPutImage, so I will spare my fingers
and not repeat that documentation here. There is one
additional parameter, however, called
&lsquo;&lsquo;send_event&rsquo;&rsquo;. If this parameter is
passed as True, the server will generate a
&lsquo;&lsquo;completion&rsquo;&rsquo; event when the image
write is complete; thus your program can know when it is
safe to begin manipulating the shared memory segment
again.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The completion
event has type XShmCompletionEvent, which is defined as the
following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct {
    int   type;              /* of event */
    unsigned long serial;   /* # of last request processed */
    Bool send_event;         /* true if came from a SendEvent request */
    Display *display;        /* Display the event was read from */
    Drawable drawable;       /* drawable of request */
    int major_code;     /* ShmReqCode */
    int minor_code;     /* X_ShmPutImage */
    ShmSeg shmseg;      /* the ShmSeg used in the request */
    unsigned long offset;   /* the offset into ShmSeg used */
} XShmCompletionEvent;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The event type
value that will be used can be determined at run time with a
line of the form:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">int CompletionType = XShmGetEventBase (display) + ShmCompletion;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If you modify the
shared memory segment before the arrival of the completion
event, the results you see on the screen may be
inconsistent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To read image data
into a shared memory XImage, use the following:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">Status XShmGetImage (display, d, image, x, y, plane_mask)
     Display *display;
     Drawable d;
     XImage *image;
     int x, y;
     unsigned long plane_mask;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Where
&lsquo;&lsquo;display&rsquo;&rsquo; is the display of
interest, &lsquo;&lsquo;d&rsquo;&rsquo; is the source
drawable, &lsquo;&lsquo;image&rsquo;&rsquo; is the
destination XImage, &lsquo;&lsquo;x&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;y&rsquo;&rsquo; are the offsets within
&lsquo;&lsquo;d&rsquo;&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;&lsquo;plane_mask&rsquo;&rsquo; defines which planes
are to be read.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To destroy a shared
memory XImage, you should first instruct the server to
detach from it, then destroy the segment itself, as
follows:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">XShmDetach (display, shminfo);
XDestroyImage (image);
shmdt (shminfo.shmaddr);
shmctl (shminfo.shmid, IPC_RMID, 0);</pre>


<a name="5. USE OF SHARED MEMORY PIXMAPS"></a>
<h2>5. USE OF SHARED MEMORY PIXMAPS</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Unlike X images,
for which any image format is usable, the shared memory
extension supports only a single format (i.e. XYPixmap or
ZPixmap) for the data stored in a shared memory pixmap. This
format is independent of the depth of the image (for 1-bit
pixmaps it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what this format is)
and independent of the screen. Use XShmPixmapFormat to get
the format for the server:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">int XShmPixmapFormat (display)
        Display *display;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If your application
can deal with the server pixmap data format (including
bits-per-pixel et al.), create a shared memory segment and
&lsquo;&lsquo;shminfo&rsquo;&rsquo; structure in exactly the
same way as is listed above for shared memory XImages. While
it is, not strictly necessary to create an XImage first,
doing so incurs little overhead and will give you an
appropriate bytes_per_line value to use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">Once you have your
shminfo structure filled in, simply call:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:30%; margin-top: 1em">Pixmap XShmCreatePixmap (display, d, data, shminfo, width,
                         height, depth);
        Display *display;
        Drawable d;
        char *data;
        XShmSegmentInfo *shminfo;
        unsigned int width, height, depth;</pre>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The arguments are
all the same as for XCreatePixmap, with two additions:
&lsquo;&lsquo;data&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;shminfo&rsquo;&rsquo;. The second of the two
is the same old shminfo structure that has been used before.
The first is the pointer to the shared memory segment, and
should be the same as the shminfo.shmaddr field. I am not
sure why this is a separate parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">If everything
works, you will get back a pixmap, which you can manipulate
in all of the usual ways, with the added bonus of being able
to tweak its contents directly through the shared memory
segment. Shared memory pixmaps are destroyed in the usual
manner with XFreePixmap, though you should detach and
destroy the shared memory segment itself as shown above.</p>
