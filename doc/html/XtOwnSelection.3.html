<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>XtOwnSelection</i>   function
informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism that a widget believes it owns
a selection. It returns  <i>True</i>   if the widget has successfully become the
owner and  <i>False</i>   otherwise. The widget may fail to become the owner if
some other widget  has asserted ownership at a time later than this widget.
Note that widgets can lose selection ownership either  because someone
else asserted later ownership of the selection  or because the widget voluntarily
gave up ownership of the selection. Also note that the lose_selection procedure
is not called  if the widget fails to obtain selection ownership in the
first place. <p>
The <i>XtOwnSelectionInrcremental</i>   procedure informs the Intrinsics
incremental selection mechanism that the specified widget wishes to own
the selection. It returns <i>True</i>   if the specified widget successfully becomes
the selection owner or <i>False</i>   otherwise. For more information about <i>selection</i>,
<i>target</i>, and <i>time</i>, see Section 2.6 of the <i>Inter-Client Communication Conventions
Manual</i>. <p>
A widget that becomes the selection owner using <i>XtOwnSelectionIncremental</i>
  may use <i>XtDisownSelection</i>   to relinquish selection ownership. <p>
The <i>XtDisownSelection</i>
  function informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism that the specified
widget is to lose ownership of the selection. If the widget does not currently
own the selection either  because it lost the selection  or because it
never had the selection to begin with, <i>XtDisownSelection</i>   does nothing.
<p>
After a widget has called <i>XtDisownSelection</i>,   its convert procedure is
not called even if a request arrives later  with a timestamp during the
period that this widget owned the selection. However, its done procedure
will be called if a conversion that started  before the call to <i>XtDisownSelection</i>
  finishes after the call to <i>XtDisownSelection</i>.
