  <H2><A NAME="45"></A>8. Data and Data Structures </H2>


<H3><A NAME="46"></A>8.1. Command line data </H3>

<p>Command line options are typically global, and are stored in global
variables.  These variables are read-only and are available to drivers
via a function call interface.  Most of these command line values are
processed via helper functions to ensure that they are treated consistently
by all drivers.  The other means of access is provided for cases where
the supplied helper functions might not be appropriate.</p>
<p>Some of them are:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    xf86Verbose               verbosity level
    xf86Bpp                   -bpp from the command line
    xf86Depth                 -depth from the command line
    xf86Weight                -weight from the command line
    xf86Gamma                 -{r,g,b,}gamma from the command line
    xf86FlipPixels            -flippixels from the command line
    xf86ProbeOnly             -probeonly from the command line
    defaultColorVisualClass   -cc from the command line
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>If we ever do allow for screen-specific command line options, we may
need to rethink this.</p>
<p>These can be accessed in a read-only manner by drivers with the following
functions:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>int xf86GetVerbosity()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the value of <code>xf86Verbose</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>int xf86GetDepth()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the <code>-depth</code> command line setting.  If not
set on the command line, <code>-1</code> is returned.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>rgb xf86GetWeight()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the <code>-weight</code> command line setting.  If not
set on the command line, <code>{0, 0, 0}</code> is returned.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>Gamma xf86GetGamma()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the <code>-gamma</code> or <code>-rgamma</code>,
<code>-ggamma</code>, <code>-bgamma</code> command line settings.
If not set on the command line, <code>{0.0, 0.0, 0.0}</code>
is returned.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>Bool xf86GetFlipPixels()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if <code>-flippixels</code> is
present on the command line, and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>const char *xf86GetServerName()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns the name of the X server from the command line.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="47"></A>8.2. Data handling </H3>

<p>Config file data contains parts that are global, and parts that are
Screen specific.  All of it is parsed into data structures that neither
the drivers or most other parts of the server need to know about.</p>
<p>The global data is typically not required by drivers, and as such, most
of it is stored in the private <code>xf86InfoRec</code>.</p>
<p>The screen-specific data collected from the config file is stored in
screen, device, display, monitor-specific data structures that are separate
from the <code>ScrnInfoRecs</code>, with the appropriate elements/fields
hooked into the <code>ScrnInfoRecs</code> as required.  The screen
config data is held in <code>confScreenRec</code>, device data in
the <code>GDevRec</code>, monitor data in the <code>MonRec</code>,
and display data in the <code>DispRec</code>.</p>
<p>The XFree86 common layer's screen specific data (the actual data in use
for each screen) is held in the <code>ScrnInfoRecs</code>.  As has
been outlined above, the <code>ScrnInfoRecs</code> are allocated at probe
time, and it is the responsibility of the Drivers' <code>Probe()</code>
and <code>PreInit()</code> functions to finish filling them in based
on both data provided on the command line and data provided from the
Config file.  The precedence for this is:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
command line  -&gt;  config file  -&gt;  probed/default data
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>For most things in this category there are helper functions that the
drivers can use to ensure that the above precedence is consistently
used.</p>
<p>As well as containing screen-specific data that the XFree86 common layer
(including essential parts of the server infrastructure as well as helper
functions) needs to access, it also contains some data that drivers use
internally.  When considering whether to add a new field to the
<code>ScrnInfoRec</code>, consider the balance between the convenience
of things that lots of drivers need and the size/obscurity of the
<code>ScrnInfoRec</code>.</p>
<p>Per-screen driver specific data that cannot be accommodated with the
static <code>ScrnInfoRec</code> fields is held in a driver-defined
data structure, a pointer to which is assigned to the
<code>ScrnInfoRec</code>'s <code>driverPrivate</code> field.  This
is per-screen data that persists across server generations (as does the
bulk of the static <code>ScrnInfoRec</code> data).  It would typically
also include the video card's saved state.</p>
<p>Per-screen data for other modules that the driver uses (for example,
the XAA module) that is reset for each server generation is hooked into
the <code>ScrnInfoRec</code> through it's <code>privates</code>
field.</p>
<p>Once it has stabilised, the data structures and variables accessible to
video drivers will be documented here.  In the meantime, those things
defined in the <code>xf86.h</code> and <code>xf86str.h</code>
files are visible to video drivers.  Things defined in
<code>xf86Priv.h</code> and <code>xf86Privstr.h</code> are NOT
intended to be visible to video drivers, and it is an error for a driver
to include those files.</p>


<H3><A NAME="48"></A>8.3. Accessing global data </H3>

<p>Some other global state information that the drivers may access via
functions is as follows:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Bool xf86ServerIsExiting()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the server is at the end of a
generation and is in the process of exiting, and
<code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>Bool xf86ServerIsResetting()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the server is at the end of a
generation and is in the process of resetting, and
<code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>Bool xf86ServerIsInitialising()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the server is at the beginning of
a generation and is in the process of initialising, and
<code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>Bool xf86ServerIsOnlyProbing()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the -probeonly command line flag
was specified, and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
<p><code>Bool xf86CaughtSignal()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the server has caught a signal,
and <code>FALSE</code> otherwise.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="49"></A>8.4. Allocating private data </H3>

<p>A driver and any module it uses may allocate per-screen private storage
in either the <code>ScreenRec</code> (DIX level) or
<code>ScrnInfoRec</code> (XFree86 common layer level).
<code>ScreenRec</code> storage persists only for a single server
generation, and <code>ScrnInfoRec</code> storage persists across
generations for the lifetime of the server.</p>
<p>The <code>ScreenRec</code> <code>devPrivates</code> data must be
reallocated/initialised at the start of each new generation.  This is
normally done from the <code>ChipScreenInit()</code> function, and
Init functions for other modules that it calls.  Data allocated in this
way should be freed by the driver's <code>ChipCloseScreen()</code>
functions, and Close functions for other modules that it calls.  A new
<code>devPrivates</code> entry is allocated by calling the
<code>AllocateScreenPrivateIndex()</code> function.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>int AllocateScreenPrivateIndex()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>This function allocates a new element in the
<code>devPrivates</code> field of all currently existing
<code>ScreenRecs</code>.  The return value is the index of this
new element in the <code>devPrivates</code> array.  The
<code>devPrivates</code> field is of type
<code>DevUnion</code>:</p>
<p>
<pre>
        typedef union _DevUnion {
            pointer             ptr;
            long                val;
            unsigned long       uval;
            pointer             (*fptr)(void);
        } DevUnion;
	
</pre>
</p>
<p>which allows the element to be used for any of the above types.
It is commonly used as a pointer to data that the caller allocates
after the new index has been allocated.</p>
<p>This function will return <code>-1</code> when there is an
error allocating the new index.</p>

</blockquote>
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>The <code>ScrnInfoRec</code> <code>privates</code> data persists
for the life of the server, so only needs to be allocated once.  This
should be done from the <code>ChipPreInit()</code> function, and Init
functions for other modules that it calls.  Data allocated in this way
should be freed by the driver's <code>ChipFreeScreen()</code> functions,
and Free functions for other modules that it calls.  A new
<code>privates</code> entry is allocated by calling the
<code>xf86AllocateScrnInfoPrivateIndex()</code> function.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>int xf86AllocateScrnInfoPrivateIndex()</code>
<blockquote>
<p>This function allocates a new element in the <code>privates</code>
field of all currently existing <code>ScrnInfoRecs</code>.
The return value is the index of this new element in the
<code>privates</code> array.  The <code>privates</code>
field is of type <code>DevUnion</code>:</p>
<p>
<pre>
        typedef union _DevUnion {
            pointer             ptr;
            long                val;
            unsigned long       uval;
            pointer             (*fptr)(void);
        } DevUnion;
        
</pre>
</p>
<p>which allows the element to be used for any of the above types.
It is commonly used as a pointer to data that the caller allocates
after the new index has been allocated.</p>
<p>This function will not return when there is an error allocating
the new index.  When there is an error it will cause the server
to exit with a fatal error.  The similar function for allocation
privates in the <code>ScreenRec</code>
(<code>AllocateScreenPrivateIndex()</code>) differs in this
respect by returning <code>-1</code> when the allocation fails.</p>
