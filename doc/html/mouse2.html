<p>The XFree86 X server supports four classes of mice:
serial, bus, PS/2, and USB mice.</p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Serial mouse</b><dd><p>The serial mouse has been the most popular pointing device for
PCs.  There have been numerous serial mouse models from a number of
manufactures.  Despite the wide range of variations, there have been relatively
few protocols (i.e. data format) with which the serial mouse talks
to the host computer.</p>
<p>The modern serial mouse conforms to the PnP COM device specification
so that the host computer can automatically detect the mouse
and load an appropriate driver.
The XFree86 X server supports this specification and can detect
popular PnP serial mouse models on most platforms.</p>

<dt><b>Bus mouse</b><dd><p>The bus mouse connects to a dedicated interface card in an expansion
slot.
Some video cards, notably those from ATI, and integrated I/O
cards may also have a bus mouse connector.
Some bus mice are known as `InPort mouse'.</p>
<p>Note that some mouse manufactures have sold a package including a serial mouse
and a serial interface card.  
Do not confuse this type of products with the genuine bus mouse.</p>

<dt><b>PS/2 mouse</b><dd><p>They are sometimes called `Mouse-port mouse'
and are becoming increasingly common and popular.</p>
<p>The PS/2 mouse is an intelligent device and may have more than
three buttons and a wheel or a roller.
It is usually compatible with the original PS/2 mouse from IBM
immediately after power up, but the PS/2 mouse with additional features
requires a specialized initialization procedure to enable these features.
Without proper initialization though, it behaves like was an ordinary
two or three button mouse.</p>

<dt><b>USB mouse </b><dd><p>The USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports are present on most modern
computers and several devices can be plugged into this bus, including
mice and keyboards. </p>
<p>The XFree86 server includes support for USB mices on some systems.</p>
</dl>
</p>
<p>Many mice nowadays can be used both as a serial mouse and as a PS/2 mouse.
They has a logic to distinguish which interface it is connected to.
However, the mouse which is not marketed as compatible with both
serial and PS/2 mouse interface lacks this logic and cannot be
used in such a way, even if you can find an appropriate
adapter with which you can connect the PS/2 mouse to a serial port
or visa versa.</p>
<p>XFree86 supports the mouse with a wheel, a roller or a knob.
Its action is detected as the Z (third) axis motion of the mouse.
As the X server or clients normally do not use the Z axis movement of the 
pointing device, a configuration option, <code>"ZAxisMapping"</code>,
is provided to assign the Z axis movement to another axis or a pair
of buttons (see below).</p>
