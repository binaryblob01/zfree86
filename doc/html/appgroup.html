<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The following
document explains the server side of the Application Group
Extension.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">To understand this
document and the accompanying source code, you should know
the C language, should be familiar with X server internals,
and should also have a general knowledge of the X Window
System.</p>

<a name="1. AppGroup Server Public Functions"></a>
<h2>1. AppGroup Server Public Functions</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The AppGroup
extension adds seven new functions that are called from
elsewhere in the server. They are: XagExtensionInit,
XagDefaultColormap, XagRootVisual, XagLeader,
XagIsControlledRoot, XagConnectionInfo,
XagCallClientStateChange.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagExtensionInit is
the extension initialization function called from
InitExtension in mi/miinitext.c. Note that an new resource
type, RT_APPGROUP, is created, specifying the destructor
function XagAppGroupFree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagDefaultColormap
returns the colormap ID that was specified in the creation
of the AppGroup. Any time CopyFromParent is specified for a
top-level window&rsquo;s colormap, i.e. in a CreateWindow or
ChangeWindowAttributes request, this function is called to
see if there is an AppGroup specific colormap to use. If
there is one, its ID is returned, otherwise None is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagRootVisual
returns the visual ID that was specified in the creation of
the Appgroup. Like XagDefaultColormap, when CopyFromParent
is specified for a top-level window&rsquo;s visual in a
CreateWindow request, this function is called to see if
there is an AppGroup specific visual to use. If there is
one, its ID is returned, otherwise 0 (zero) is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagLeader returns
the ClientPtr of the client that is the AppGroup Leader.
Normally when an application maps or configures a top-level
window a MapRequest or ConfigureRequest event is delivered
to the client, e.g. a window manager, that has selected
SubstructureRedirect on the root window. However, when the
application is part of an AppGroup, the MapRequest and
ConfigureRequest events are delivered to the AppGroup Leader
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagIsControlledRoot
returns a boolean: True if the window is a top-level window
of a client in an AppGroup, False otherwise. In a combined
server, i.e. one that provides both UI and printing, the
application may create and map windows on the
&quot;printing&quot; screens; thus it becomes necessary to
discriminate between the AppGroup&rsquo;s root window and
other root windows. If an AppGroup member creates and maps a
[top-level] window then the window&rsquo;s parent [the root
window] is tested to determine whether to send MapRequest or
ConfigureRequest events to the AppGroup Leader to to some
other client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">In the trivial case
XagIsControlledRoot returns True if the parent window has no
parent itself, i.e. it is a root window. In the case where
the application is embedded, indicated by the singleScreen
attribute being True, the parent&rsquo;s drawable ID is
compared to the AppGroup&rsquo;s root window ID, and if it
is the same, True is returned. If neither case is true, then
False is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagConnectionInfo
returns an abreviated version of the connection setup
information. When an embedded AppGroup is created the server
returns only the information about the [UI] screen that the
application is embedded within in the connection setup in
order to prevent the application from creating windows on
other screens; thus attempting to guarantee that any window
that should be embedded can be reparented into the AppGroup
Leader&rsquo;s window hierarchy.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagCallClientStateChange
is called to invoke the extension&rsquo;s client state
change callback additional times as necessary -- currently
only once, after the auth data becomes available between
ClientStateInitial and ClientStateConnected. Client state
change callbacks were introduced in the Record extension,
which specifies when the callbacks are invoked.
Unfortunately the points at which they are called are not
necessarily the best as far as the AppGroup Extension is
concerned. Adding an additional state and calling all the
callbacks works too, however this seemed unnecessary
overkill.</p>

<a name="2. AppGroup Server Private APIs"></a>
<h2>2. AppGroup Server Private APIs</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The AppGroup
extension adds the following functions which are private to
the extension: ProcXagDispatch and SProcXagDispatch,
ProcXagQueryVersion and SProcXagQueryVersion, ProcXagCreate
and SProcXagCreate, ProcXagDestroy and SProcXagDestroy,
ProcGetAttr and SProcGetAttr, ProcXagQuery and
SProcXagQuery, ProcXagCreateAssoc and SProcXagCreateAssoc,
ProcXagDestroyAssoc and SProcXagDestroyAssoc, XagResetProc,
and XagAppGroupFree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The
ProcXagDispatch, SProcXagDispatch, and XagResetProc
functions should be familiar to anyone familiar with X
server internals and I won&rsquo;t elaborate on them here.
Similarly the wrapper functions: SProcXagQueryVersion,
SProcXagCreate, SProcXagDestroy, SProcXagGetAttr,
SProcXagQuery, SProcXagCreateAssoc, and
SProcXagDestroyAssoc, as wrappers which handle swapping
integer data into the host&rsquo;s byte order will not be
explained in any detail.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagQueryVersion
returns the major and minor versions of the AppGroup
extension supported by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagCreate
creates an AppGroup. A new record in a linked list of
AppGroups is allocated and initialized. The attributes from
the request are validated and copied to the AppGroup record.
If necessary an abbreviated version of the connection setup
information is compiled and also stored in the AppGroup
record. The first time an AppGroup is created a
client-state-change callback is registered and a reference
count is incremented.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagDestroy
destroys an AppGroup an AppGroup by calling FreeResource
specifying the AppGroup ID. This will result in the
destructor function XagAppGroupFree being called. The
reference count is decremented and when it reaches zero the
client-state-change callback is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagGetAttr
returns the AppGroup Attributes to the requesting
client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagQuery
returns the AppGroup ID of an arbitrary resource to the
requesting client.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagCreateAssoc
creates an association between an X window ID and
system-specific data. In native X this functionality is
unnecessary but for various personal computers, e.g.
Macintosh, OS/2, and MS-Windows it is necessary to associate
an X window ID with the system&rsquo;s native window
identifier so that when the AppGroup Leader issues a
ReparentWindow request the personal computer X server can
lookup the system-specific window ID and make the necessary
function call(s) with it.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">ProcXagDestroyAssoc
destroys the association created with
ProcXagCreateAssoc.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagResetProc
removes the client-state-change callback, sets the reference
count to zero, and frees all the AppGroup records in the
linked list by calling XagAppGroupFree.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">XagAppGroupFree
calls CloseDownClient for each client in an AppGroup if the
AppGroup has a leader, unlinks the AppGroup record from the
linked list, frees allocated memory referenced by the
record, and finally frees the record itself.</p>

<a name="3. Known Problems in this release."></a>
<h2>3. Known Problems in this release.</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">In a combined
UI/Print server the connection setup returned to an embedded
application will not have information about the print
screens.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The LBX proxy
caches connection setup information and will return
incorrect connection setup information to an embedded
client.</p>
