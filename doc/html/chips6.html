  <H2><A NAME="9"></A>6. The Full Story on Clock Limitations </H2>

<p>There has been much confusion about exactly what the clock limitations
of the Chips and Technologies chipsets are. Hence I hope that this
section will clear up the misunderstandings. </p>
<p>In general there are two factors determining the maximum dotclock.
There is the limit of the maximum dotclock the video processor can handle, 
and there is another limitation of the available memory bandwidth. The 
memory bandwidth is determined by the clock used for the video memory.
For chipsets incapable of colour depths greater that 8bpp like the 65535,
the dotclock limit is solely determined by the highest dotclock the video
processor is capable of handling. So this limit will be either 56MHz or
68MHz for the 655xx chipsets, depending on what voltage they are driven
with, or 80MHz for the 64200 WinGine machines.</p>
<p>The 6554x and 64300 WinGine chipsets are capable of colour depths of 16
or 24bpp. However there is no reliable way of probing the memory clock
used in these chipsets, and so a conservative limit must be taken for
the dotclock limit. In this case the driver divides the video processors
dotclock limitation by the number of bytes per pixel, so that the
limitations for the various colour depths are</p>
<p>
<pre>
                        8bpp    16bpp   24bpp
64300                   85      42.5    28.33
65540/65545 3.3v        56      28      18.67
65540/65545 5v          68      34      22.67
65546/65548             80      40      26.67
</pre>
</p>
<p>For a CRT or TFT screen these limitations are conservative and the user
might safely override them with the "<code>DacSpeed</code>" option to some
extent. However these numbers take no account of the extra bandwidth 
needed for DSTN screens. </p>
<p>For the HiQV series of chips, the memory clock can be successfully probed.
Hence you will see a line like</p>
<p>
<pre>
(--) CHIPS(0): Probed memory clock of  40.090 MHz
</pre>
</p>
<p>in your startx log file. Note that many chips are capable of higher
memory clocks than actually set by BIOS. You can use the "<code>SetMClk</code>"
option in your XF86Config file to get a higher MClk. However some
video ram, particularly EDO, might not be fast enough to handle this,
resulting in drawing errors on the screen. The formula to determine the
maximum usable dotclock on the HiQV series of chips is</p>
<p>
<pre>
Max dotclock = min(MaxDClk,  0.70  * 8 * MemoryClk / (BytesPerPixel + 
                (isDSTN == TRUE ? 1 : 0)))
</pre>
</p>
<p>if you chips is a 69030 or 69000 or</p>
<p>
<pre>
Max dotclock = min(MaxDClk,  0.70  * 4 * MemoryClk / (BytesPerPixel + 
                (isDSTN == TRUE ? 1 : 0)))
</pre>
</p>

<p>otherwise. This effectively means that there are two limits on the
dotclock. One the overall maximum, and another due to the available
memory bandwidth of the chip.  The 69030 and 69000 have a 64bit memory
bus and thus transfer 8 bytes every clock thus (hence the 8), while
the other HiQV chipsets are 32bit and transfer 4 bytes per clock cycle
(hence the 4). However, after accounting for the RAS/CAS signaling
only about 70% of the bandwidth is available. The whole thing is
divided by the bytes per pixel, plus an extra byte if you are using a
DSTN. The extra byte with DSTN screens is used for the frame
buffering/acceleration in these screens. So for the various Chips and
Technologies chips the maximum specifications are</p>
<p>
<pre>
                    Max DClk MHz      Max Mem Clk MHz
65550 rev A 3.3v          80                38 
65550 rev A 5v           110                38
65550 rev B               95                50
65554                     94.5              55
65555                    110                55
68554                    110                55
69000                    135                83
69030                    170               100
</pre>
</p>
<p>Note that all of the chips except the 65550 rev A are 3.3v only. Which
is the reason for the drop in the dot clock. Now the maximum memory clock
is just the maximum supported by the video processor, not the maximum
supported by the video memory. So the value actually used for the memory
clock might be significantly less than this maximum value. But assuming your
memory clock is programmed to these maximum values the various maximum dot
clocks for the chips are</p>

<p>If you exceed the maximum set by the memory clock, you'll get corruption
on the screen during graphics operations, as you will be starving the
HW BitBlt engine of clock cycles. If you are driving the video memory
too fast (too high a MemClk) you'll get pixel corruption as the data
actually written to the video memory is corrupted by driving the memory
too fast. You can probably get away with exceeding the Max DClk at 8bpp
on TFT's or CRT's by up to 10% or so without problems, it will just generate
more heat, since the 8bpp clocks aren't limited by the available memory
bandwidth.</p>
<p>If you find you truly can't achieve the mode you are after with the default
clock limitations, look at the options "<code>DacSpeed</code>" and 
"<code>SetMClk</code>". Using these should give you all the capabilities
you'll need in the server to get a particular mode to work. However use
caution with these options, because there is no guarantee that driving the
video processor beyond it capabilities won't cause damage.</p>
