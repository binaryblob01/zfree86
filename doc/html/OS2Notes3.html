  <H2><A NAME="3"></A>3. Compiling and Installing </H2>

<p>You need about 300MB of free HPFS space for the whole system. This does not
include space for the postscript and troff documentation files. I have never
installed them. Nor did I install the test subtree.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Install all the above utilities. Refer to the corresponding documentation.
Verify that everything works well, particularly EMX.</li>
<li>It is a good idea to use the same or a similar structure I have.
I have made a directory <code>\x11</code> on the partition for compiling and have
put everything below this tree. I found that a clean tree occupies
less than the half space of the disk, this gives me the opportunity to
rename this tree to <code>\x11old</code> and copy a new version to the
same disk to produce diffs. Last time the complete tree was
arranged under the root directory <code>xc</code>, this would become 
<code>\x11\xc</code> then.</li>
<li>To unpack the files you would usually execute the command
<pre>
gzip -dc file.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</pre>
 
in the <code>\x11</code> directory. At the end you will usually see the
irritating, but non-fatal message "gzip: stdout Broken pipe". Ignore it.</li>
<li>After that, is is likely necessary to apply some patches, either from
the XConsortium or from the XFree86 project. Before you do this, enter
<pre>
      chmod -R a+rw \x11\xc
      
</pre>
 
to make certain files in the tree writable.</li>
<li>There should be a file <code>added-XXX</code> accompanying the patch file
which lists the files that are newly created. The patch program has
a problem with creating new directories, so we need to create them
on advance. For each <code>added-XXX</code> file you find, execute from
<code>\x11</code> 
<pre>
xc\config\util\added added-XXX
</pre>

If there is no <code>added-XXX</code> file available, you can make one with
the following instructions:
<pre>
      grep "\*\*\* xc/" patchfile &gt;added-file
      
</pre>

Edit <code>added-file</code> with a text editor and remove the <code>*** </code> at
the beginning and the time stamp at the end (search for a TAB and
erase to the end of the line). You get a list of file paths, one in a
line, which is the input to the added utility.</li>
<li>After that you can apply the patches in the right order. Usually this
is done by a command
<pre>
      patch -p -E &lt;patchfile 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee patchlog
      
</pre>

from the <code>\x11</code> directory. Be aware to use the right
patch - OS/2 has a utility with the same name and different functionality.
Don't use the recommended <code>-s</code> option, this makes <code>patch</code> quiet,
and you won't see problems in the patchlog file. Use
<pre>
      find \x11 -name *.rej -print 
      find \x11 -name *# -print
      
</pre>

to find any rejects and unapplied patches (attention: yet another OS/2
program with wrong functionality). Normally there shouldn't
be any problems of this kind, else you have made a mistake. Finally
remove the original files with
<pre>
      find \x11 -name *.orig -print -exec rm {} ;
      
</pre>
</li>
<li>Go to the <code>xc/config/cf</code> directory and edit the <code>xf86site.def</code>
file to match your requirements (you probably don't want to compile
all X servers). Certain changes must be set to the following values:
<ul>
<li>Disable if not already done any PC98 server; PC98 (Japanese XFree86)
does not work yet. Porters from Japan are welcome!</li>
<li><code>#define WacomSupport            NO
#define ElographicsSupport      NO</code>
Both options are not yet supported.</li>
<li>Tcl* and Tk* don't need to be set explicitly. Reasonable defaults
are in the other config files, provided you have a complete 
XFree86/OS2 binary tree with the tcl/tk runtime support installed.</li>
<li><code>#define BuildDynamicLoading   NO</code>
This does not work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to the directory <code>xc\util\compress</code> and 
<code>make compress.exe</code> there. Install the program produced 
there in your path. I stumbled more than once on half-ported
compress programs on OS/2 ftp servers that are defective w.r.t.
reading and writing stdin/stdout. In some stage (font compression)
otherwise you will get a core dump of mkfontdir, because all
compressed fonts are corrupt.</li>
<li>Set the environment variable <code>X11ROOT</code> to something different than
it is; otherwise the installation process will overwrite your
original XFree86/OS2 installation. If you have not set this variable,
go back to the prefix section of this document: you have forgotten
something.</li>
<li>Copy the file <code>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/etc/bindist/OS2/host.def.os2</code>
to the location <code>xc/config/cf/host.def</code>. Use this file to do
any specific modifications to imake variables, rather than editing
the file xfree86.cf, imake.tmpl, or os2.cf directly.</li>
<li>Copy the file <code>xc/config/util/buildos2.cmd</code> into the <code>xc</code>
directory. If this is a second or later attempt, you might need to
copy the saved toplevel Makefile.os2 back to Makefile.</li>
<li>Execute this <code>buildos2.cmd</code> command in the <code>xc</code> directory;
it will produce a logfile <code>buildxc.log</code> in this directory.</li>
<li>Go have a bucket of coffee, or better, buy new coffee - in Colombia!
The compile will need between 2 and 20 hours, depending on your
selections, and the horse power of your hardware.</li>
<li>When finished, view the logfile for errors, and fix the problems if
there are some. I have managed to compile the whole system
flawlessly, so there is at least one configuration that works.</li>
<li>Finally, from the <code>xc</code> dir, execute
<pre>
      xmake install
      xmake install.man
      
</pre>
</li>
<li>There are a few minor glitches in the installation:
<ol>
<li>The xdm and linkkit directories will fail in compile and installation.
This is no problem and has no effect on the rest of the system.</li>
<li>The imake.exe which is installed in <code>\XFree86\bin</code> is usually defective.
The one which was built initially and installed in the root directory
of the drive where you have the source tree is okay. So simply copy
this <code>\imake.exe</code> to the <code>\XFree86\bin</code> directory 
manually. Some day this might be fixed.</li>
<li><code>XF86Setup</code> is not ported yet and won't work with the tcl/tk port
available for XFree86/OS2. My idea was to replace this by some native
installation tool, which I didn't find the time to do yet. Feel free
to spend a bit of time to play with XF86Setup if you like.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>Well, you see, this was quite easy :-)</p>
