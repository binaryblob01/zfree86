lndir - create a shadow directory of symbolic
links to another directory tree 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>lndir</b> [ <i>options</i> ] <i>fromdir</i> [ <i>todir</i>
] 
<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
The <i>lndir</i> program makes a shadow copy  <i>todir</i>  of a directory
tree <i>fromdir,</i>  except that the shadow is not populated with real files
but instead with symbolic links pointing at the real files in the  <i>fromdir</i>
directory tree.  This is usually useful for maintaining source code for
different machine architectures.  You create a shadow directory containing
links to the real source, which you will have usually mounted from a remote
machine.  You can build in the shadow tree, and the object files will be
in the shadow directory, while the source files in the shadow directory
are just symlinks to the real files. <p>
This scheme has the advantage that
if you update the source, you need not  propagate the change to the other
architectures by hand, since all source in all shadow directories are symlinks
to the real thing: just cd to the shadow directory and recompile away. <p>
The
<i>todir</i> argument is optional and defaults to the current directory.  The <i>fromdir</i>
argument may be relative (e.g., ../src) and is relative to <i>todir</i> (not the current
directory). <p>
If you add files, simply run <i>lndir</i> again.  New files will be
silently added.  Old files will be checked that they have the correct link.
<p>
Deleting files is a more painful problem; the symlinks will just point
into never-never land. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>
<p>
Normally <i>lndir</i> outputs the name of each subdirectory
as it descends into it.  The <b>-silent</b> option suppresses these status messages.
 <b>-silent</b> may be abbreviated to <b>-s</b>. <p>
If a file in <i>fromdir</i> is a symbolic link,
<i>lndir</i> will make the same link in <i>todir</i> rather than making a link back to
the (symbolic link) entry in <i>fromdir.</i>  The <b>-ignorelinks</b> option changes this
behavior.  The link created in <i>todir</i> will point back to the corresponding
(symbolic link) file in <i>fromdir</i>.  If the link is to a directory, this is
almost certainly the wrong thing.  The <b>-ignorelinks</b> option may be abbreviated
to <b>-i</b>. <p>
If a file in <i>fromdir</i> is a symbolic link to a directory and the <b>-withsymdirs</b>
option is specified, <i>lndir</i> will shadow the directory tree the symbolic
link points to, whether or not the <b>-ignorelinks</b> is also specified.  The <b>-withsymdirs</b>
option may be abbreviated to <b>-d</b>. <p>
<i>lndir</i> will remove dangling symbolic links
and empty directories in the shadow tree.  The <b>-clean</b> option may be abbreviated
to <b>-c</b>. <p>
<i>lndir</i> will do the cleaning phase only, not creating the shadow tree.
The <i>todir</i> argument may be provided, and defaults to the current directory
when not provided. <p>
<i>lndir</i> will normally not shadow any BitKeeper, RCS, SCCS,
CVS, CVS.adm and .svn subdirectories, nor any .cvsignore and .gitignore files.
 This option causes these directories and files to be treated as any other,
rather than ignored. <b>-withrevinfo</b> may be shortened to <b>-r</b>. <p>
By default, <i>lndir</i>
does not shadow files or directories whose name is .DS_Store, or ._.DS_Store,
or starts with '.#', or ends in '~'.  This option, which may be abbreviated to
<b>-E</b>, causes such files to also be shadowed. <p>
This option adds <i>name</i> to an initially
empty list of filenames in <i>fromdir</i> that are not to be shadowed.  <b>-except</b>
may be specified as <b>-e</b>.  This option may be repeated as many times as necessary.

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>Diagnostics</a></h2>
The program displays the name of each subdirectory it enters,
followed by a colon.  The <b>-silent</b> option suppresses these messages. <p>
A warning
message is displayed if the symbolic link cannot be created. The usual problem
is that a regular file of the same name already exists. <p>
If the link already
exists but doesn't point to the correct file, the program prints the link
name and the location to which it does point. <p>
